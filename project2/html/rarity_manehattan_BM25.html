[crowd cheering] Princess Celestia: You delegates have traveled far and  wide to represent your cities as we seek to celebrate and learn from all  the unique places that make up our wonderful land of Equestria  At  tonight's welcome reception, Princess Cadance will dedicate this  beautiful friendship statue made up of gemstones from each of your home  cities  [crowd oohing and ahhing] Spike: [licks lips] Princess Celestia: Now I'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit: Princess Twilight Sparkle! [crowd cheering] Twilight Sparkle: [tired] Thank you, everypony  With  delegates from over fifty cities attending three days of conferences,  receptions, and meetings, this is the largest Grand Equestria Pony  Summit yet  And let me tell you, putting it all together has led to more  than one sleepless night  We're so excited to have you here and to  learn more about life all across this great land of ours  [crowd cheering] Twilight Sparkle: And now my faithful assistant Spike would like to say a few words  Spike: Um, hello, everypony! I'm here to help any way I can  So if there's anything I can do for any of you— Neigh Sayer: We love you, Princess Twilight! Delegate 2: We love all the princesses! [crowd cheering] Spike: [sighs] I guess everypony loves a princess  Hmph  [theme song] [knocking] [door slamming] Spike: Ugh! Princess Cadance: Spike! [thud] Princess Cadance: Spike? Spike: [muffled] A little help? Princess Cadance: Spike, we need you! Spike: Of course! What can I do? [door opens] Spike: Whoa, what happened to you? Twilight Sparkle: [groans] [tired] I'm sorry, Spike  I just    [yawns]    need a quick    nap  Napkin! Tell the delegates I'll    [trails off] Princess Cadance: She's been awake three straight days  preparing for the summit  We need to make sure she gets some rest today   She'll never be able to attend the welcome reception in this condition   Can I count on you to see to it that she isn't disturbed? Spike: I promise! I won't let you down! Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] [marching music] [telescope squeaking] Spike: Perfect  [bird singing] Spike: Not on my watch  [bird singing] Spike: Uh, excuse me? Can you keep it down a little? Oh, no! [door opens] [bird singing] Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] Spike: I'll give you birdseed! Worms! Anything! Just please stop singing before you wake the princess! Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] Spike: Huh  I can't believe that worked  [polo ponies shouting] Twilight Sparkle: [groaning] Spike: Hyah! Polo ponies: [surprised noises] Spike: [sighs] Uh, hi fellas  Sorry to break up your  game, but there's sort of an important diplomatic summit kind of thingy  going on, and it involves a princess needing to sleep, and, uh    maybe  you could move your game somewhere else? [chainsaw buzzing] Spike: Uh, the princess thanks you for your  understanding! Excuse me  Do you have to do this right now? [sneezes]  Oh, no! Are those dragon-sneeze trees? [sniffles] Horticultural Pegasus: Uh, these are too top-heavy  Wouldn't take much to bring these beauties down  [trees creaking] Spike: [strained] Can't you just wait a few hours? Horticultural Pegasus: Sorry, it's a public hazard  I got my orders  Spike: Well, I've got my orders too from Princess Twi    Twi    Twilight   ! [sneezes] Horticultural Pegasus: Princess Twilight? [laughs] Why didn't you say so? Gee, I reckon they'll keep a few more hours  Spike: Huh  Good thing I've got the princesses on my side  [jackhammer rattling] Spike: [vibrating yelps] Aw, come on! Excuse me? [shouting] Excuse me, sir! I really need you to— [jackhammer stops] —stop right now! Oops  Public Works Pony: [loudly] Lemme guess, the noise? Sorry, but we can't have a broken water main! Spike: Ugh, you couldn't do this yesterday?! Public Works Pony: [loudly] Hey, pal, I'm just tryin' to make sure everything runs smooth for the summit! Spike: But there is no summit without Princess Twilight, and she needs things to be kept quiet around here  So if you don't mind, I'd— Public Works Pony: [loudly] All right, all right, if that's how she wants it! [beat] [quickly] But if something happens, it ain't my fault! [near-silence] Spike: Hmph! Princess Twilight will be rested, Princess Cadance will be proud, and Princess Spike deserves a little reward  Hah! Princess Spike  [laughs] [licks lips] "Joe Pescolt" and "March Gustysnows": [arguing] "Joe Pescolt":    Oh, lemme tell you somethin', alright? I worked forever on this speech, and I know I have more— Spike: Uh, hi  Can I help you? "March Gustysnows": My friend here, the distinguished  pony from up <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>, and I are in a bit of a pickle, and we need the  Princess Twilight to resolve it  Spike: Uh, can you talk a little quieter? And maybe come back later? "March Gustysnows": Oh, sure now, gosh, I wish we could  but, uh, we're both supposed to give speeches about our local economies  in five minutes, and we've been booked in the same hall! "Joe Pescolt": I had the room first  And let's be honest, my speech is more important  "March Gustysnows": Point of order there, sir, but I think you'll find that my speech is the more important one, don't'cha know? "Joe Pescolt": Look, youse is gonna have a lot of unhappy delegates on your hooves unless we get a ruling from Princess Twilight right now! Spike: [sighs] Lemme see what I can do  [door opens] Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] Huh? Spike: [squeals] Twilight Sparkle: Does something need scheduling? Spike: Oh, uh, yeah  Two delegates have speeches booked in the same hall  What do I do? Twilight Sparkle: Okay, no problem  Just put the hay in the apple and eat the candle, hm? Spike: Huh? Twilight Sparkle: [yawns] [thud] Spike: Oh, I need an answer, but Twilight can't even think straight! Oh, my gosh, what am I supposed to do?! [door opens and shuts] "Joe Pescolt": Well? What did she say? She picked me, right? "March Gustysnows": Hey, hey, hey  Let's not be too hasty there, good sir  I got a feeling she went with me  "Joe Pescolt": He-hey, if she didn't pick me, it ain't hard to see that as an insult to all of <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>! You know what I'm sayin'? "March Gustysnows": And it'd sure be a shame to see something like a scheduling issue create a nasty old rift between Whinnyapolis and Ponyville  "Joe Pescolt": So? What did the Princess say? "March Gustysnows": Come on, now! Spit it out! Spike: Um, she said that    Well, she said that she    she wants you to    share it? [beat] "Joe Pescolt": If that's what the princess wants, what are ya gonna do? "March Gustysnows": The princess is always right! "Joe Pescolt": Listen  No hard feelings  This is not about you or me, alright? I mean, this is      "March Gustysnows": Now there ya go, we got a solution! I have no hard feelings    Spike: [sighs] Now, back to more important things! [chews] Annoyed Delegate: Combining those two talks was a disaster! The hall was overcrowded and the speakers just shouted over each other! Spike: Huh? B-but— Annoyed Delegate: Why would the princess have made such a decision?! [other annoyed delegates chattering] Spike: Uh, by order of Princess Twilight, be quiet! [echoes out] Fluffy Clouds: I was really looking forward to the  "Don't Spend All Your Bits" Speech, but when I went into the hall,  [tearing up] a pony had taken my seat  A pony who used to be my friend! Spike: Your friend took your seat? Hah, big deal! Why don't you just— Fluffy Clouds: No offense, but I don't need some random dragon's opinion  I-I want to hear what Princess Twilight thinks  Spike: [sighs] Fine  [door opens and shuts] Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] [door opens] Spike: Uh    [door shuts] Spike: The princess says no friendship should end over a seat  You should forgive your friend! Fluffy Clouds: [gasps] Of course! Oh, the princess is so wise! [delegates chattering] Spike: I could tell these delegates anything as long as they think it came from Twilight  [beat] Alright! Who's next? [musical sequence] Spike: So, how can Princess Twilight be of service? Fancy Pants: Well, as host city, the Canterlot delegation feels it's only right that we should get passes to every meeting and party, yes? Spike: Well, that doesn't seem fair—I mean, Princess Twilight doesn't think that seems fair  Fancy Pants: Ehhh    yes, yes, very well  It was worth a try though, wasn't it, old chap, hm? Spike: This is great! I just took care of a whole bunch  of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up!  Wonder if anypony else needs the princess's help? [door opens] [paper rustling] Spike: If I can check a few of these meetings off  Twilight's schedule, then when she wakes up, she won't have to think  about anything but the reception  [background ponies chattering] Spike: Uh, it says here you have a meeting with Princess Twilight? "Frazzle Rock": [lisping] Uh, yuppers  She wanted me to  prep her on all the different gemstones in the Citizens of Equestria  statue before the reception tonight  Spike: Okay, go ahead  "Frazzle Rock": [lisping] Um, well, I'd rather, um, tell the princess directly  Spike: Well, if it helps, you can call me "Princess  Spike"  No-no-no, it's alright  The princess asked me to take care of a  few things for her  That's why I came to find you  "Frazzle Rock": [lisping] Um, if you say so  Spike: The princess says so! "Frazzle Rock": [lisping] Uh, okay  Let's start with topaz    Public Works Pony: [bites apple] Spike: I'm here for your two o'clock! Public Works Pony: You?! But I'm supposed to be briefing Princess Twilight on the progress with the water main! Spike: I speak for the Princess  Public Works Pony: Uh, well, uh, can I start fixing it again? I'm getting a little worried, to be honest  [pipe groaning] Spike: Actually, Twilight still needs her rest, and her no-noise policy is still in effect for a few more hours  Sorry  Princess Cadance: Hey, Spike  What's going on? Spike: Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down! Princess Cadance: What do you mean? Spike: Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight  could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't  have to worry about them when she wakes up  Princess Cadance: Are you sure she'd want you doing that? There are so many things to keep track of at this summit  Spike: Nah, don't worry  I got it covered  I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her! Princess Cadance: Oh, okay  Well, thank you for keeping Twilight's stress level down  As long as that's the real reason you're doing it  Spike: Well, why else would I be doing it? Princess Cadance: You're not enjoying speaking for Twilight a little bit? Spike: Enjoying it? [laughs] No way! The only things I'm  doing by order of the princess are for the good of the summit! [laughs  to himself] Spike: [sighs] [vibrating] By order of the princess  [steam hissing] Spike: By order of the princess! [chews] Spike: [through gritted teeth] By order of the princess   ! Spike: [sighs] Princess life is good! [chews] Princess Cadance: It sure is, but it's also hard work, isn't it? Spike: Eh, it's not so bad  Princess Cadance: Spike, I'm concerned you might be abusing your relationship with Twilight  Spike: What are you talking about? I'm a great princess—I mean, Twilight's a great princess! And I've been working hard to help her! When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship! I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to! I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep! And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue! I'm a decision-making master! [beat] Spike: [sighs] Okay  So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions  But it's not like anything bad happened  [thok] [trees falling] [water main bursting] Princess Cadance and Spike: [screaming] Spike: This is unexpected! Princess Cadance: I'll go shut off the main! You get rid of the water! [splashing] [crystals growing] [door groaning] [splash] Spike: At least the statue's okay  [sniffles] Oh  Oh, no  Oh, no! [sneezes] [gems tinkling] Spike: Oh, bless me    [delegates shouting] Fancy Pants: Oh, my! What is the meaning of this?! Spike: Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, and— Fancy Pants: How could you let a water main burst on Canterlot's most important day?! Public Works Pony: Hey, don't look at me! Princess Twilight said to stop working on it! Fancy Pants: Well, what about these trees?! I ordered them trimmed to avoid just such a situation! Horticultural Pegasus: But the princess told me to stop, bub! Fancy Pants: Why would the princess make such horrible decisions?! This all could have been prevented! [delegates shouting] Spike: Please, everypony, listen! I'm so sorry all this happened! Fancy Pants: What are you apologizing for? These were Princess Twilight's awful decisions! "March Gustysnows": I'm about to blow my stack on Princess Twilight, I'll tell you that for nothin'! "Joe Pescolt": Yeah, me too! Fancy Pants: I'll not let Princess Twilight give  Canterlot a bad name in the eyes of Equestria! Come on, everypony! Let's  go give her a piece of our minds! [delegates shouting] Spike: Please! You've got it all wrong! [delegates shouting] Spike: [panting] Wait! I mean, [hushed] wait! Fancy Pants: What is it now?! There's an angry mob here that demands satisfaction! Spike: It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we? "Joe Pescolt": Wake her?! What?! You're tellin' me that she's asleep?! [delegates shouting] [door opens and shuts] [lock clicks] Spike: [panting] Fancy Pants: [muffled] Princess, we must speak at once! Spike: She is SLEEPING! Twilight Sparkle: [snoring] Spike: [sighs] Twilight Sparkle: [yawns] I'm glad you're here, Spike  We've got a lot to do! Do you know if the water main was fixed? Spike: Uh, you seem well-rested  Twilight Sparkle: I haven't slept like that since I was a filly! Spike: You haven't? Well, at least I got one thing  right  And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me  Maybe I did do a  good job today! [knocking] [doors burst open] Spike: [yelps] [delegates shouting] Twilight Sparkle: Fancy Pants, what's wrong? Fancy Pants: Don't play games with me, Princess! You know why I'm here! Twilight Sparkle: Is this about the special privileges you wanted? Because this seems a little extreme! Fancy Pants: The special privileges?! The last thing on my mind is special privileges! Twilight Sparkle: What's going on, Spike? Spike: Um    you needed to sleep  And Princess Cadance  told me you weren't to be disturbed  And there was this bird, and,  well    long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf  Twilight Sparkle: A few decisions?! Spike: Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good  intentions! Honest! Until I    didn't anymore  I'm sorry, Twilight  I  guess I got a little carried away  It-it just felt so good to have  ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters  I guess I was  just enjoying feeling like a princess  Twilight Sparkle: Well, Spike, one of the most important things a princess can do is realize when she's made a mistake and fix it  Spike: How do I do that? Princess Cadance: You could start with them  Spike: [sighs] Uh, hi there, everypony  So I guess I owe  you all a pretty big apology  It's funny  Here we are at a summit that  brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think  about was myself  You all came here to celebrate the things that make  each of our cities so unique and special  But instead of getting into  the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to  make myself feel good  [gems clinking] Fancy Pants: The Canterlot ruby goes here, old sport  "March Gustysnows": And ours goes here, don't'cha know? [delegates chattering, gems clinking] Spike: Does this mean you forgive me? "Joe Pescolt": Sure! You know, the whole idea of the statue is that when each of us plays our own small part, it adds up to somethin' great  Fancy Pants: Quite  Just like how all our cities make up the beautiful land of Equestria! Princess Cadance: I hereby dedicate the Citizens of Equestria statue to everypony who plays their part, no matter how big or how small! [delegates cheering] Spike: [sniffles] Aw, come on!

Apple Bloom: Oh, nothin'    except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark! Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: What?! Apple Bloom: She says it's a pair of scissors! Scootaloo: So    she's good at cutting stuff? Sweetie Belle: Of course! She was always fussing with her bangs and tail! I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist! Apple Bloom: But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> CMCs? Scootaloo: Well, not Babs  She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark  Apple Bloom: Oh, wow  I guess you're right  Sweetie Belle: I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't  want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day  Can you imagine getting  stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like? Apple Bloom: No    or at least I hadn't    Sweetie Belle: Don't worry, Apple Bloom  Most of your  family has apple-related cutie marks  I bet yours will be, too  And  what's not to like about apples? Scootaloo: There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them— What? Sweetie Belle: Not helping  [theme song] Apple Bloom: I guess I just spent so much time worryin'  about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would  happen after  There's just so many things I never considered  Applejack: I'm sure there are, but you don't need to— Apple Bloom: What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me? Applejack: Well, that's just ridicu— Apple Bloom: What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean,  we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore!

Pest Control Pony: Hah, please  Anypony with a trombone can get rid of parasprites  I'm talking about the serious stuff! You ever hear of    twittermites? [lightning cracks] Apple Bloom: Twittermites? Pest Control Pony: Pest ponies like you and me are the only things keeping these live wires from destroying half of Equestria! Apple Bloom: Pest ponies? Pest Control Pony: It's no easy trade! Even the best of  us yearns for the day they can move on to greener pastures  Oh, now that  you're here to take over, my day has finally come! Apple Bloom: Take over? Pest Control Pony: You're gonna need to stop repeating what I say and pay attention if you want to learn anything  Apple Bloom: I'm sorry  I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'  Pest Control Pony: Don't worry  With a cutie mark like that I'm sure you've got the touch  Apple Bloom: The touch? Oh, sorry  Pest Control Pony: Now, you're gonna need to be quick  Once these things get out, it can get pretty shocking  [twittermites buzzing] Apple Bloom: Wait, what do you mean? [zap!] Apple Bloom: Ow! Pest Control Pony: Hah, told you! And the further apart they spread, the more powerful these jolts will get! Apple Bloom: What do I do?!

Apple Bloom: It's pest pony  Silver Spoon: Eh, it sure is! Ew! Diamond Tiara: I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever! Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [laughing] Silver Spoon: But look on the bright side! Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one! Apple Bloom: That's not funny  Diamond Tiara: Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend! Apple Bloom: Stop it! Silver Spoon: Here, bug! Here, bug! Will you be my friend, bug? Because nopony else will! [laughing] Apple Bloom: You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are! Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [laughing] [glass cracking] Apple Bloom: [sighs] I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but    this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for  Mysterious Voice: Why should you have to keep it, then? Apple Bloom: Who's there?! What do you mean?! Mysterious Voice: If your cutie mark bothers you so much, get rid of it! Apple Bloom: Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead! Mysterious Voice: As easily said as done  [wind blows] Apple Bloom: Huh  Now that is some serious magic  [ponies panicked] Apple Bloom: Hey! Where's everypony goin'?!

A good night's sleep'll fix just about— [gasps] Well, no wonder you were so worked up! Apple Bloom: What? Applejack: Looks like somepony got her cutie mark! Apple Bloom: Again?! I mean    I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it! Applejack: More like what? Apple Bloom: Never mind  I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off! Applejack: I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse  and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark  But before you go,  make sure you do all your    chores   ? [horseshoe clinking] Apple Bloom: Whooo! Scootaloo: Why all the excitement? Sweetie Belle: Yeah, what's going on? Apple Bloom: [coyly] Oh, nothin'    except this brand new cutie mark! Scootaloo: That's amazing! Sweetie Belle: Wow! Apple Bloom: I know! Scootaloo: That's so cool! Apple Bloom: I don't suppose either of you got yours? Scootaloo: Nope  Sweetie Belle: Me neither    Apple Bloom: I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together  Scootaloo: Me too    Sweetie Belle: But I'm still super excited for you! Scootaloo: Absolutely! Apple Bloom: I know! [knocks on podium] Let's call this  meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two  more cutie marks  Sweetie Belle: Um, yeah    the thing is    Apple Bloom: What? Scootaloo: Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark    Apple Bloom: Oh, yeah    Just like Babs Seed    Well, I  could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're  gonna do    Sweetie Belle: Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only  Apple Bloom: Oh  Right  I guess I should just come back later, then   ? Sweetie Belle: Why? I mean, you can't come in then either  Apple Bloom: Oh  Sweetie Belle: Rules are rules  Scootaloo: I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends  [door slams] Apple Bloom: What?! [creepy forest noises] Apple Bloom: Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny! [wind blows] Mysterious Voice: More trouble with cutie marks? Apple Bloom: No! I mean, w— yeah, I mean    Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble! Mysterious Voice: Sounds to me like cutie marks and trouble are two peas in the same pod  Apple Bloom: I guess so    I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem! Mysterious Voice: Your wish is my command  [wind blows] [crunch] Scootaloo: Hey, Apple Bloom  Why'd you want to meet here? Apple Bloom: Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere! Scootaloo: Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we    both sort of got our cutie marks  Apple Bloom: You did?! What are they? Scootaloo: Oh, we don't have time to go into all that  Sweetie Belle: And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse  Scootaloo: Yeah, we've got responsibilities now  Sweetie Belle: But maybe we'll see you later  Scootaloo: Much later  Apple Bloom: Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark  back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a  second! Nooooooooooo! [rooster crows] Apple Bloom: What in Equestria's goin' on?! Applejack: [muffled] Breakfast! Apple Bloom: I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is  Apple Bloom: Uh    Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse  Applejack: See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix— Well, no wonder you were so worked up    Apple Bloom: Wh— Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying to— Granny Smith: Weeeell, what do we have here? Apple Bloom: What is it, Granny? What's wrong?! Granny Smith: Oh, nothin', right, Applejack? Applejack: Right    Nothin' at all    Right, Big Mac? Big McIntosh: Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark  Applejack: Eeyup  Apple Bloom: Oh, no! What is it now?! [spotlights turning off then on] Big McIntosh: [echoing] Well, I can tell you what it ain't  It ain't no apple  Granny Smith: Nnope! Apple Bloom: What?! Applejack: [in Big McIntosh's voice] And we don't have room for non-apples  Big McIntosh: [in Applejack's voice] Nnope  Granny Smith: [in Big McIntosh's voice] Time for you to mosey on  You can't stay here  Apple Bloom: But this is my home! Big McIntosh: Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name  Granny Smith: Eeyup! Big McIntosh: I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack? Applejack: Eeyup! [wind blows] Apple Bloom: Noooooooooo! [thump] Apple Bloom: Ugh! Pinkie Pie: [gives rooster crow] Apple Bloom: Alright, this is getting ridiculous  [pause] Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark  What the?! [music playing backwards] Apple Bloom: [frustrated grunt] I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live! Mysterious Voice: Back so soon? Apple Bloom: All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now! Mysterious Voice: I didn't cast a spell, on you or anypony else  I only did what you wanted  Apple Bloom: Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?! Mysterious Voice: You didn't want to catch bugs, and I  helped  You didn't want to lose friends, and I helped  If there's a  problem with your family, I'm sure I can help with that too  Apple Bloom: I don't want your help! Just get away from me! Princess Luna: Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow  Apple Bloom: Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself? Princess Luna: Of course, Apple Bloom  It's your dream  Apple Bloom: If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up? Princess Luna: Sometimes we can worry about a thing so  much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare  I don't  suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there? Apple Bloom: Yeah    I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark  Princess Luna: Well, that is the same as worrying about  who you are  That is all a cutie mark is  If you cannot accept who you  are, your life might seem like a bad dream  [blows] Apple Bloom: But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too? Princess Luna: Of course  Apple Bloom: Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is! Princess Luna: Indeed  Apple Bloom: But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark  Princess Luna: Oh, I wouldn't say that  [door opens] Sweetie Belle: [exhales] [inhales] [cutie mark pinging] [bucket clunking] [door opens] [Scootaloo's wings flapping] [cutie mark pinging] Scootaloo: [screams] [plop] Scootaloo: [hyperventilating] Apple Bloom: Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too? Princess Luna: It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close  [door opens] Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Princess Luna! Princess Luna: I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake  Sweetie Belle: We're still asleep? Scootaloo: Cool! Apple Bloom: Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order! [podium honks] Apple Bloom: I know we all got pretty anxious when we  found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have  nightmares every night from now until we get ours! Scootaloo: Me neither! Apple Bloom: And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us! Sweetie Belle: It's lucky we're all scared of the same things  That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are! Princess Luna: And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T  Apple Bloom: Exactly! Scootaloo: Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff? Apple Bloom: I know! Let's put together a care package for her! Sweetie Belle: That way she'll know she isn't alone! Apple Bloom: We wouldn't want her to think that just  because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh     maybe we should wait 'til we wake up  Princess Luna: Good idea  Apple Bloom: [gasps] [rooster crows] Apple Bloom: [sighs] [pancakes splatting] [Applejack] There ain't no call to worry So don't you cry or fret  [Apple Bloom] A cutie mark won't change me No matter what I get  Applejack: Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better  Apple Bloom: You have no idea  Applejack: See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'  Apple Bloom: I guess so  I just wish it hadn't been so exhaustin'  [credits]			<br>

Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Granny Smith: Oh, I sure would appreciate that  Granny's a little rustier in the giddy-up since the last time the Apples all got together  Applejack: You may be a tad old, Granny, but you're as feisty and full of spark as ever– Granny Smith: Who you callin' old?! Applejack: Uh    I just meant    Why don't you let me  take over puttin' the reunion together this time 'round?

Granny Smith: That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie  Applesauce when she was just about your age  Now, she used to go by  another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half  her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam  Yeah  Never did find  them teeth in all those jars  Apple Bloom: Hey! That's you, Granny! Granny Smith: Sure is  Apple family's been workin' on that same old quilt since our first reunion  Young Granny Smith: I can do it! Ngh! Oh, fingle-fangle!

Granny Smith: That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown stallion  Applejack: Better get twice as much honey and flour, then    fifty more buckets of apples    more oil    wood for the fire    Granny Smith: Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast  my rump! This one sure brings back memories  Y'know how Babs is your  favorite cousin? Well, Apple Rose is mine  The two of us entered the  seven-legged race every reunion! Young Apple Rose: We're gonna win this one, cousin! Young Granny Smith: You bet your hot-diggety-derriere we are! C'mon, cousin, speed'er on up! Young Apple Rose: [yelps] [laughs] Young Apple Rose and Young Granny Smith: [laughing] Granny Smith: Never won a single one of them races  Applejack: Races  We'll need cloth ties, finish line    Not much to a seven-legged race  Hmm    Granny Smith: And, of course, we can't forget to take  the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at  the end of every reunion, let's us see how our family's grown! Applejack: Photo in front of the barn  Got it  Apple Bloom: You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don'tcha? Granny Smith: Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin'  more at this one  Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony!  We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll  all be able to make the next one? Applejack: That's true! Busy as everypony's lives are  gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next  time 'round  Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most  memorable reunion we've ever had! I'd better get started    I've got  some plannin' to do! Granny Smith: Oh, hootenanny! Would you look what your second cousin is wearin' on her head? Apple Bloom and Granny Smith: [giggling] [clock pendulum ticking] Apple Bloom: [groans] Applejack: Apple Bloom! What are you doin' up? Apple Bloom: I was gonna ask you the same thing  Applejack: I can't sleep  My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion!

[ponies cheering] Applejack: [through megaphone] My name's Applejack, and I  just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya!  We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and  some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns  And there's  lots more to come after that! Hope y'all enjoy it! [ponies cheering] Apple Bloom: Where is she? Babs Seed: [blows] Apple Bloom: Babs! Babs Seed: Cuz! Apple Bloom: I know it hasn't been that long since we've seen each other, but– Apple Bloom and Babs Seed: –It felt like forever! Babs Seed: I can't wait to tell you about my new school! Apple Bloom: I can't wait to hear all about it! Babs Seed: Jeepers, where do I start? Okay  So first day– Applejack: Babs! Huh, so glad you could come! Babs Seed: What am I, gonna miss out on spendin' time with my favorite cousin? Forget about it! [blows] Applejack: Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course? Apple Bloom: We kinda wanna catch up a little bit first    Applejack: Don't you worry  There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins  Applejack: Alrighty, ponies! Ready to have some fun? Babs Seed: Whoa, is that the finish line? It's like a mile away or somethin'! Applejack: Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race  Apple Bloom: There's more? Applejack: Much more  Trust me, I have put together  somethin' you are never gonna forget  After the seven-legged race,  you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin'  for apples! [splash] Applejack: Then you'll run around these trees fifty  times until you're real good and dizzy  Then you'll jump these big  wooden hurdles  And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance  plates on your head while sayin' "Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly  pluffnuggets" over and over and over again  Last pony standin' wins! [pause] Apple Bloom: Seriously? Applejack: Seriously! C'mon, y'all! Let's start makin' some memories! On your mark    get set    go! Applejack: Whooeee! Lookin' good, everypony! Ooh, better go check on the quilt  Granny Smith: How long you had those new choppers, Auntie Applesauce? Auntie Applesauce: A lady never reveals the age of her teeth  Apple Rose: Ugh  Auntie Applesauce: Don't you roll your eyes at me, Miss  Apple Rose! I imagine you two think I have forgotten what you did to my  parasol six reunions ago? Granny Smith: [giggles] We were just usin' it to help break open that piñata! Apple Rose and Granny Smith: [laughing] Auntie Applesauce: Applejack, delightful to see you  Are you gonna join us in some quiltin'? Applejack: Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy  Y'all should get started, though! Granny Smith: We couldn't find our rocking chairs  Applejack: I got rid of 'em to make room for these  This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt! Apple Rose: Finish it? [engine starting] [very loud sewing machine rattling] [Auntie Applesauce's teeth chattering] Applejack: [over noise] Won't that be excitin'? Apple Rose: [over noise] What's that? Applejack: [over noise] I said, won't that be– [rattling stops] Applejack: –excitin'? Auntie Applesauce: I suppose, although I have been told that too much excitement can wreak havoc on this youthful complexion of mine  Apple Rose: Oh  Granny Smith: [giggling] [rattling restarts] Applejack: [over noise] That's the spirit! Granny Smith: [over noise] What did she say? Apple Rose: [over noise] What? Granny Smith: [over noise] Good gracious! Apple Rose: [over noise] Golden Delicious? I think he's racing with his cousin! [dizzy music] Babs Seed: [dizzy] How are Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle? Apple Bloom: [dizzy] Great! Ugh    Babs Seed: [dizzy] You alright? Apple Bloom: [dizzy] So    dizzy    [Wilhelm scream] [crash] Apple Bloom: Ugh    Babs Seed: [sigh] [splat] Big McIntosh: [sniffs] [licks lips] [gulps] [whistles innocently] Apple Dumpling: You've got eight now, dont'cha? Apple Leaves: Oh, sure do  Tell you what, my Apple Tart may just be a baby, but he is a hoot! Applejack: Havin' fun? Apple Leaves: Sure are! Applejack: Better pick up the pace on those fritters  though, huh? Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left  Roll, fold, crimp,  slide to the left  Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left  Now you try!  That's it! Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals! We want every  Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria! Apple Bloom and Babs Seed: Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets  Apple Bloom: Any other blank flanks at your new school? Babs Seed: Yeah  Two  Apple Bloom and Babs Seed: Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets  Apple Bloom: Do they wanna be Crusaders? Babs Seed: Totally! Apple Bloom: Great! Apple Bloom and Babs Seed: Pappy pony picked a  pluck of prickly pluffnuggets  Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly  pluffnuggets  Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets  Babs Seed: Ah can' thfeel my tongue  Apple Bloom: Neh nehber  Applejack: [through megaphone] Alright, Apples, break! [sewing machine rattling stops] Apple Bloom: [sighs] Finally    Applejack: Ooh, can't forget to capture all these  memories for Granny's album! Huh  Nothin' all that memorable there  Or  there  Or there  C'mon, Applejack, think  You gotta kick this thing up a  notch! Hm    Apple Bloom: I get that my big sis wants this to be like a super-awesome reunion, but that was ridiculous! Babs Seed: I thought we'd never get a minute to just hang out! Applejack: And your minute's up! Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them  Apple Bloom: Applejack, I haven't had any time with Babs! We were so busy with that obstacle course, we didn't even get to talk! Applejack: There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride  Babs Seed: Hayride? Applejack: Alright, everypony! Step right up, take a  seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions! Now, I know y'all've  been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories  And in all of our  past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the  farm  Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try  somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'  So let's get this show on the  road! Giddy-up! Stallions: [whinnying] Ponies: Whoa! [crunch] [Auntie Applesauce's teeth chattering] [chomp] Auntie Applesauce: [teethless] I just had those professionally polished  Granny Smith: Where in the world does that girl have us headed? The west orchard? Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Granny Smith: What?! I was jokin'! Why, we haven't tended those fields since all the trees went and got filled up with    [gulps] [thunk] [fruit bats squeaking] [ponies oohing and ahhing] Babs Seed: Wowza! Never seen real fruit bats before! [ding] [fruit bat licking lips] [aeroplane engine noises] Applejack: Uh-oh  Auntie Applesauce: [yelps] [ponies yelping] Apple Bloom: Everypony! Jump out!! [crash] [dust settling] Applejack: [crying] Ruined  Everythin' is ruined  [crunch] Applejack: Oh, Granny  I'm so, so sorry  Granny Smith: Oh, it's alright, child  Applejack: But it's not alright  Just look at this! The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed! Apple Bloom: Maybe that's a good thing  Applejack: How can that possibly be a good thing? Granny Smith: Applejack, you had us so caught up in all  the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks  we've been doin' it with! Applejack: Really? [ponies agreeing] Applejack: [sighs] Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be  in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna  remember about this reunion    is that it was the worst one we ever  had  Granny Smith: Oh, hey now    everypony's still here,  ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got  to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em  Applejack: The family photo! Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year    unless    Everypony! I have one more activity! Granny Smith: Applejack    Applejack: Trust me, Granny Smith  This'll be one we'll remember for all the right reasons  [Applejack] Yee-hoo! Raise this barn, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four Up, up, up, go the beams Hammer those joints, work in teams Turn 'em round quick by the right elbow Grab a new partner, here we go Apple family: Yeah!

Granny Smith: Oh! Apple Rose, Auntie Applesauce and Granny Smith: [laughing] Apple Bloom: I can't wait for the next reunion! Babs Seed: Me neither! Apple Bloom: I mean, obviously we have to get together before then! Babs Seed: [chuckles] Obviously  Granny Smith: Oh, you did it, Applejack! You put on a reunion that everypony will remember! Applejack: Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way  Granny Smith: Yeah, just a couple  Granny Smith: Ohohoh, that's a good one  Apple Bloom and Granny Smith: [laughing] Apple Bloom: Oh! Applejack: Dear Princess Celestia, Today I learned a great lesson about family, which, if you  think about it, is really the first group of friends you ever make   Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to  do much to make that time memorable  Even the simplest of activities can  take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the  "who" long after you've forgotten the "what"  Your humble subject, Applejack [music] [credits]			<br>

She'll probably just ruin that one, too  Apple Bloom: [sighs] Sweetie Belle: We could always tell Applejack  Babs Seed: [echoing] What are you, a snitch? Apple Bloom and Scootaloo: No! Sweetie Belle: [groans] Apple Bloom: We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales!  Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks  We'll just avoid her like  the plague until she goes home  Scootaloo: Avoid her  Yeah, how hard can that be? [Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo] Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [Apple Bloom] First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat [Scootaloo] But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast [Apple Bloom] Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead [Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo] Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do? Got a bully on our tail Gotta hide, we gotta bail Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you Gotta run, we gotta flee Gotta hurry, don't you see? Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [Apple Bloom] Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight [Scootaloo] Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then [Apple Bloom] Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead [Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo] Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do? Got a bully on our tail Gotta hide, we gotta bail Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you Gotta run, we gotta flee Gotta hurry, don't you see? Why so mean? Why so crude? Why so angry? Why so rude? Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends? Isn't it sad? Is this how it all ends? Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad- Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad- Babs Seed, Babs Seed- [Scootaloo] She's just a bad, bad seed!  Apple Bloom: Babs may have run us out of town, but at least we still have the club– Babs Seed: Hey! What're you doing at my clubhouse? Scootaloo: Y- y- your clubhouse?! This is our clubhouse! Babs Seed: Well, it was yours, and now it's mine  Silver Spoon: And mine  Diamond Tiara: And mine  Apple Bloom: That's not fair, Babs! We never did anything to you! Babs Seed: And let's keep it that way  Now scram, crybabies! Babs Seed, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump! Diamond Tiara, Silver Spoon, and Babs Seed: [laughing] Sweetie Belle: [takes deep breaths] [wails] Sweetie Belle: [crying] Apple Bloom: That Babs has really gone too far this time! Scootaloo: Kicked out of our own clubhouse! Apple Bloom: And my own bed! Scootaloo: Seriously? Apple Bloom: Super-seriously  Sweetie Belle: We need to talk to Applejack  Apple Bloom and Scootaloo: No! Sweetie Belle: <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>? Apple Bloom and Scootaloo: No! Sweetie Belle: Twilight? Apple Bloom: No, no, no! We need to fight back! Scootaloo: Yeah! Fight back! How're we gonna do that? [Pinkie's polka begins playing in background] Apple Bloom: [gasp] By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade! Scootaloo: [gasps] Yeah! Wait, what? Apple Bloom: [laughs under her breath] When you look up 'embarrassed' in the dictionary    [deep breath] Her face will be there! Babs Seed: [snoring] Sweetie Belle: Moo! Moo! [cow chewing] Sweetie Belle: Moo! Moo! [squeaking] Babs Seed: Aheh    [resumes snoring] Apple Bloom: Are those from the Carousel Boutique? Sweetie Belle: Yup  Apple Bloom: Excellent  Scootaloo: [blows] Sweetie Belle: Ooh! Scootaloo: Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner  They use it for decorating cakes  Sweetie Belle: That must be what <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> uses on her emergency edible boots! Scootaloo: The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff    Did you bring the thing from the place? Sweetie Belle: What's that? Apple Bloom: Granny Smith's kitchen timer  Sweetie Belle: What's that for? Scootaloo: [sing-song voice] You'll see! [giggles] Apple Bloom: C'mon, y'all, let's get to it  We only got a  few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs  won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it! [A-Team-like music] [scissors cutting] [hammering] Sweetie Belle: [yawns] Is this it? Scootaloo: [tired] I think    we're a go  Sweetie Belle: [tired] Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us  Cutie Mark Crusaders: [tired] Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho! [Pinkie's polka plays in background] "Roma": Hot carrot crêpes! Get 'em here, get 'em hot! [thud] Spike: [licks lips] [wrench noises] Babs Seed: [blows] Whoaaaa    Sweetie Belle: Isn't it smashing? No! I-I didn't mean smashing! I mean    Isn't it a hit? No! No, I- No! No hitting! I meant– Scootaloo: Well, don't even think about riding it, Babs  Sweetie Belle: Ow! [motor running] Scootaloo: You had your chance  [boing] Babs Seed: See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies! [door slams] Apple Bloom: [hushed] The timer set? Sweetie Belle: Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders! Applejack: Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float? Apple Bloom: Yeah  We thought she deserved to be the    center of attention  Cutie Mark Crusaders: [giggling] Applejack: Well, that's just super sweet of y'all,  makin' Babs feel so special  Y'know, after all the heartache she's been  havin' in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>  [pop] Apple Bloom: Heartache? Applejack: Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't  want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in  <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank  Apple Bloom: T-t-t-teased? Sweetie Belle: B-Bullies?! Applejack: Yup  She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home  I'm so proud of y'all  You've done a good deed  [balloons deflating] Scootaloo: So that's why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time  Apple Bloom: She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to be a bully instead! Sweetie Belle: And now we've turned into bullies too! Cutie Mark Crusaders: What do we do?! [crowd cheering] Diamond Tiara: Nice float, Babs  Babs Seed: Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks  Diamond Tiara: Too cool for mule, Babs  Mule: [brays] Apple Bloom: We gotta stop that float! [kitchen timer ticking] [band playing very loudly] Apple Bloom: [almost inaudible] Applejack, quick you have to– Applejack: Huh? Apple Bloom: [almost inaudible] Quick, you have to help us– Applejack: What? [band stops] Apple Bloom: We booby-trapped it! [pause] [band suddenly starts again] Scootaloo: Babs! Bully! Payback! No time to explain! We've just gotta get Babs out of that float! [kitchen timer ticking] Spectator: Oof, my popcorn! Apple Bloom: Sorry! Scootaloo: 'Scuse me! Ah, whoops  Apple Bloom: Whoa! Scootaloo: Pinkie Pie, let us in! ("lettuce in") Pinkie Pie: [laughs] Funny joke! Apple Bloom: No, really! Let- us- in! Pinkie Pie: Ohhh! Here! [tires screeching] [ponies panicking] Apple Bloom: Babs! You gotta get out of that float! Babs Seed: You're not getting your float back, crybabies! Sweetie Belle: But it's booby tra– [thud] Pinkie Pie: Veggie salad! Apple Bloom: Huh? Pinkie Pie: Veggie salad! [crash] Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Veggie salad  [munching] Apple Bloom: Seriously? [engine driving away] Pinkie Pie: Hey! Don't leave me! [laughs] Leaf me! [laughs] [kitchen timer ticking] [kitchen timer ringing] Babs Seed: What the– Apple Bloom: Babs! Babs! Babs Seed: Oof! Apple Bloom: [yelling] Oooh, sweet applesauce! [thud] [squelch] Cutie Mark Crusaders: [groans of pain] Apple Bloom: Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time  [camera clicking] Applejack: Are y'all okay? Sweetie Belle: Yeah    we're fine  Scootaloo: No sweat  Babs Seed: After I'd been so mean to ya    you saved me! Apple Bloom: [sighs] About that    Babs Seed: I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake! Scootaloo: Except    we were the reason it was headed into the lake  Sweetie Belle: We booby trapped the float  Apple Bloom: Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully    Scootaloo: But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>  Sweetie Belle: And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville  But, by then    we were the ones being bullies  And    Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?! Apple Bloom: Guess what we're trying to say is    Cutie Mark Crusaders: We're sorry  Babs Seed: [blows] I'm sorry too  Applejack: [sighs] Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning  Sweetie Belle: That's what I kept on saying! Babs Seed: So    can we    start over? Apple Bloom: Definitely  Scootaloo: Yeah  [Scootaloo playing timpani] Sweetie Belle: "We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs  Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy,  gal pal, compader, chum of chums   " Scootaloo: [clears throat] Sweetie Belle: Well you wrote this  Scootaloo: Oh, uh, yeah    Sweetie Belle: "Homegirl    Amiga   " Blah blah blah  blah blah  Oh, yes, here  "   and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader! You are  solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters,  friends, confidantes    boss-om buddies    compadres   " Scootaloo: Congratulations! [quickly, under her breath] Gotta remember to revise that  Cutie Mark Crusaders: [laughing] Babs Seed: [blows] Apple Bloom: So you promise you're gonna start our <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right? Babs Seed: Yeah, and I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home  Applejack: Good  And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear? Diamond Tiara: So you're leaving huh? Great! Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks  Babs Seed: Hey! That's not how you talk to my friends! Silver Spoon: F-friends? Babs Seed: Yeah, you got a problem with that? Diamond Tiara: Well, what if I do? What are you gonna do about it? Babs Seed: Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes! [splat] [pig grunts] Sweetie Belle: I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed  Applejack: Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now? Sweetie Belle: No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in actually a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good  Get it? Applejack: Yea    No  Cutie Mark Crusaders: [laughing] [train whistles] [music] [credits]			<br>

Twilight Sparkle: Okay then! Sweetie Belle: [straining] Can't    seem    to   ! [straining] [neck clicks] Ugh! Think I threw my neck out    Scootaloo: Aw, you're okay  Apple Bloom: A little more magic practice and liftin' brooms'll be a cinch! Sweetie Belle: I doubt it  That thing weighs a ton  [door opens] Spike: Hey, has anypony seen my– Oh, there it is  [whistling] Sweetie Belle: Hmph  I'll never get my cutie mark for this    Twilight Sparkle: Maybe not  But I'm happy to keep helping you learn just for the fun of it as long as you like  Spike: Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess? Scootaloo: This is no mess! These are the carefully  arranged pieces of a unicycle I took apart and will be putting back  together    as soon as Twilight shows me how  [squee] Twilight Sparkle: Scootaloo, I already told you I won't show you how, but I'll help you find the instructions so you can figure it out yourself  Scootaloo: Ugh, I hate research! Twilight Sparkle: To your left, third shelf from the bottom  You'll find it in no time  Apple Bloom: Thanks so much for helpin' us all learn these new skills, Twilight  Twilight Sparkle: Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake  Apple Bloom: Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'  Twilight Sparkle: Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you? Apple Bloom: Well    uh    more or less  Twilight Sparkle: Well, let's try it out on this apple seedling and see how we do  Apple Bloom: Oh    I hope this works  [drip] [poof] Twilight Sparkle: [coughing] Seedling: [coughing] Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: [giggling] Apple Bloom: Layin' it on a little thick there, aren't we, pal? [theme song] [ball bouncing] Diamond Tiara: Yoo-hoo! Gather 'round! It's time! Foals: [various intrigued noises] Diamond Tiara: As you all know, I had promised to put on an amazing, first-time-ever acrobatic display for you all today! Foals: [cheering] Diamond Tiara: I know, it's so exciting  But I'm tired  Foals: Awww    Diamond Tiara: But I did not wish to disappoint you all, so I brought my butler Randolph to do them for me  Foals: [cheering] Silver Spoon: That was amazing, Diamond Tiara  Diamond Tiara: I know  I don't know how I do it  Apple Bloom: I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything! Scootaloo: She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do! Sweetie Belle: Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm    Scootaloo: Check this out! Apple Bloom: And check this out! Foals: [awed comments] Sweetie Belle: Now check this out! Diamond Tiara: [yelping] Hey, put me down! Foals: [laughing] Sweetie Belle: [giggling] Diamond Tiara: Hey, can you hear me? Sweetie Belle: Huh? Huh? What? What? Diamond Tiara: I was asking if your sister <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> will be taking you to <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> anytime soon  Silver Spoon: Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities  Scootaloo: Cool! Apple Bloom: Wow, that's    pretty nice of you guys  Sweetie Belle: Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> anytime soon  Diamond Tiara: Yeah, we figured  Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Bump, bump, sugar lump rump! [laughing] Sweetie Belle: Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all  the way to <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies!  Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time! Diamond Tiara: D-did you say Princess Twilight?! You hang out with her all the time? For real? Apple Bloom: More like just once a week  Scootaloo: She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we actually do ourselves! Diamond Tiara: You must bring me along next time you go! Silver Spoon: Bring us along! Diamond Tiara: I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, "whatever"    Silver Spoon: Me too  I thought that  Diamond Tiara: But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome! Silver Spoon: Plus, she has wings  Diamond Tiara: And she's an Alicorn  So can I– Silver Spoon: We! Diamond Tiara: –go? Apple Bloom: I don't think we should– Sweetie Belle: Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity! Apple Bloom: Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits! Sweetie Belle: But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too! Scootaloo: And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own  Apple Bloom: I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change  Diamond Tiara: Oh, my gosh! A princess lives in there! And I'm about to go inside and see her! I can't even tell you how excited I am! Silver Spoon: I can't either! [knocking] Sweetie Belle: Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff  Twilight Sparkle: Hey there, guys! Come on in! Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [squealing] Princess Twilight! Diamond Tiara: Oh, it's really her! Silver Spoon: Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it! Twilight Sparkle: Oh, and, uh, you brought guests  Great! Diamond Tiara: Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here! You have no idea  Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail? Silver Spoon: I so have to get that done  Twilight Sparkle: Actually, it's not dyed  I've always– Diamond Tiara: [gasp] Are those books in there? What a bold design choice! Silver Spoon: You should so do that, Di! Diamond Tiara: I know, right? Twilight Sparkle: Listen, I'm all for helping as many  ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just  between us, hm? Okay, which one of you wants to practice first? Sweetie Belle: Shouldn't they go first? Twilight Sparkle: No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you  Apple Bloom, go ahead  Let's see how your plant potions are coming  Apple Bloom: I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday  Scootaloo: I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom  Apple Bloom: 'Cause they laughed on the inside  Sweetie Belle: Don't worry  We won't make that same mistake again  Apple Bloom: Aw, great  Look who showed up to make fun of us  Scootaloo: So much for learning skills to be big shots  Diamond Tiara: Hey, guess what! I told everyone about your special Twilight Time! Sweetie Belle: Oh, no, here it comes    Diamond Tiara: And they all want in! Foals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under] Diamond Tiara: Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around  You're welcome  Sweetie Belle: Uh-oh    Foals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under] Sweetie Belle: Wow! All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly? Pipsqueak: We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders! Foals: [cheering] Diamond Tiara: Now, now, everypony! Demanding time with  the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do  Might I suggest you get  organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends? Silver Spoon: Everypony get in line! No pushing, no pushing! Foals: [cheering, under] Apple Bloom: What a mess  Sweetie Belle: Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now! Scootaloo: Huh? Sweetie Belle: They all think we're the greatest,  because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and  biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight! Apple Bloom: We just said like two seconds ago that  invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're  supposed to bring the whole class? Sweetie Belle: Relax  I got this  Apple Bloom: I don't like this, Sweetie Belle    Sweetie Belle: You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't  So what's the problem? Scootaloo: This feels like a trick  Sweetie Belle: What's tricky about inviting Twilight out  for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us?  Seems like the least we can do for the princess! Pipsqueak: Did someone say "princess"? Sweetie Belle: When I told you when you could come  eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or  three of you, tops! Foals: Oops    Scootaloo: She's coming! Sweetie Belle: Okay! But stay out of sight! Diamond Tiara: As you wish, Sweetie Belle  Sweetie Belle: Yes, as I wish  Twilight Sparkle: [messy eating noises] Mmm! Mmmm, mm!  [with mouth full] I didn't realize how hungry I was! I'm so glad you  asked me to join you here today    [swallows] I'm so honored! Mm! Sweetie Belle: You are? Twilight Sparkle: When you first asked me to help you  develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted  to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?'  You all remind me of myself when I was your age! Sweetie Belle: Yes, well    we feel the same way  Apple Bloom: That's why we invited you here  Scootaloo: All because of our love of learning! Twilight Sparkle: [sipping drink] Pinkie Pie: Twilight! Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half! Twilight Sparkle: I know  I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here! Pinkie Pie: Totally! Hey, what's going on out there? Oh,  never mind, they're gone  They're back! Never mind, they're gone  La  la-la la-la    [cameras clicking] Apple Bloom: [through gritted teeth] Knock it off! Twilight Sparkle: What in the world is going on out– [gasp] Apple Bloom: What was all this? And this? Scootaloo: I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad  Sweetie Belle: Oh, we're gonna look sad all right    [doors close] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] [long pause] Uh, can I    help you? Foals: [excited screaming] Diamond Tiara: Get my picture with her! Pipsqueak: Me first! Silver Spoon: Hey! Get out of the shot! Sweetie Belle: This is bad  Scootaloo: Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us  Apple Bloom: I told ya this was a terrible idea  Twilight Sparkle: You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends  Oh, there you are! Pipsqueak: Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess! Twilight Sparkle: This isn't my regular hangout  I'm only here to be with them  Pipsqueak: You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go? Cutie Mark Crusaders: Huh? Twilight Sparkle: Thanks, guys, this was fun! See ya around! Foals: [excited chattering] Pipsqueak: I'm opening a new lemonade stand! Won't you come to the grand opening? I'll give you free lemonade for a week! Sweetie Belle: Relax  I know exactly how to handle this  [scissors cutting] Foals: [cheering] [glasses clinking] Pipsqueak: More lemonade? Sweetie Belle: Don't mind if I do! Classmate Pony 2: Done shining your hooves! It's an honor to do you the favor! Scootaloo: Whoa, so bright I can see myself! Apple Bloom: And so can I! Nice job bedazzlin' my bow! What do I owe you? Classmate Pony 3: Your gratitude is thanks enough  Diamond Tiara: You three must come to my pool party  It'll be much cooler than this  Sweetie Belle: Look who's inviting who to her fancy house! Apple Bloom: I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders  Cutie Mark Crusaders: Yeah! [splash] Apple Bloom: [laughs] Sweetie Belle: Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here  Why is this party cooler, exactly? Diamond Tiara: Because of all the ponies we're keeping out  Sweetie Belle: This has been great, but we have to go  It's Twilight Time  Diamond Tiara: So, we're coming too, right? Sweetie Belle: Um    a-actually, no  We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, so– Diamond Tiara: Really? After all the favors we did for you? After all the favors they did for you? Foals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under] Sweetie Belle: Okay, I know exactly how to handle this  Run! Foals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under] Cutie Mark Crusaders: [straining] Sweetie Belle: Go, go, go! Scootaloo: We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain! Sweetie Belle: This way! I know a shortcut! Foals: Twilight Time! [continuing under] Apple Bloom: Then we run, like the wind! Foals: Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Sweetie Belle: [gasps] [out of breath] We    made    it    Quick! Knock on– [tires screeching] [knocking] [door opens] Sweetie Belle: Twilight, we can explain  Apple Bloom: We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us! Scootaloo: We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest! Twilight Sparkle: Oh, don't be silly  I only meant that  for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together  But  if you want to share your time with others, that's fine  Scootaloo: So you're not mad? Twilight Sparkle: Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos! Foals: [excited chattering] Twilight Sparkle: Turns out we'll need some more than that  Spike: [sighs] Foals: [excited chattering] Twilight Sparkle: Before we start, we should maybe get a  bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner  Ponies  who want to learn potions over here  Bookworm ponies over there  Apple Bloom: Incredible  Looks like everything's workin' out just fine  Scootaloo: And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us  Sweetie Belle: Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this! Twilight Sparkle: Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things  Diamond Tiara: Thank you, princess! Silver Spoon: We love you, princess! Foals: [You're awesome, etc ] Twilight Sparkle: Okay, okay, let's settle down  If you  want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously  sharing this time  Sweetie Belle: It was nothing, really  We just felt it was the right thing to do  Diamond Tiara: Hmph! What a laugh  Twilight Sparkle: Let's begin over here  And what would you like to learn, little one? Pipsqueak: I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader! Twilight Sparkle: And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm? Pipsqueak: Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess! Sweetie Belle: Oh, boy  Twilight Sparkle: Is this true? Sweetie Belle: We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things  Really and truly! Twilight Sparkle: Prove it  Sweetie Belle: Huh?! Twilight Sparkle: If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week  Show me how much better you got  Apple Bloom: Uh, well, uh    we    can't  Scootaloo: We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff  Twilight Sparkle: Hm, I see  Sweetie Belle: No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck!  You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get  ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the  amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time! Foals: [intrigued chatter] Sweetie Belle: Unfortunately, since we don't have  Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one  of the scooters from outside  Pipsqueak: Hey! That's my scooter! Scootaloo: You got us into this mess, kid  Might wanna roll with us  Pipsqueak: Huh? Sweetie Belle: Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed  with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen  And I will  begin by using my magic to lift this broom! Scootaloo: Ta-da! Apple Bloom: Become a tree! Sweetie Belle: Rise! [creaking] [boom] Sweetie Belle: That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped  Twilight Sparkle: Looks like Twilight Time is over  Diamond Tiara: And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore  Foals: Oooh! Silver Spoon: Guess they didn't come here to learn after all  Twilight Sparkle: Well, neither did any of you  Foals: Awww    Sweetie Belle: We're really sorry, Twilight  We made a huge mistake  Apple Bloom: And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you  Scootaloo: Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now  Thanks, Twilight  [poof] Apple Bloom: Thanks    Sweetie Belle: Thanks    Twilight Sparkle: Sweetie Belle? Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance? Spike: [straining] Aw, come on! Sweetie Belle: I guess Twilight must not be so  super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our  sisters do  Boy, did we get our priorities messed up  We started acting  special because we were friends with someone special  We almost forgot  the real reason she's special – because she's our friend  But she  forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of  magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the  other kind  Twilight Sparkle: Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you  See you next time! Sweetie Belle: We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal  Well    almost back to normal  I just hope no one sees us  Apple Bloom: 'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now? Scootaloo: Or because we look ridiculous? Sweetie Belle: A little of both, actually  Twilight Sparkle: [laughs] [credits]			<br>

Twilight Sparkle: And I'm bored! I wanna do something! Things have been so slow around here and I just— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Twilight! Twilight! Ooh, Twilight, darling! Oh, thank goodness! It seems that my— Applejack: [panting] Whew! Got here as fast I— Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Yes! Finally! We've been summoned! I wonder where the map wants us to— Spike: Uh, Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: [groans] [theme song] Applejack: Where do you think— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [excited squeals] <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>! We've been called to <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>! Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit! And now I return    with a purpose! Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm  It looks like you've been summoned to this particular neighborhood here  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: We're off to solve a friendship problem in one  of the busiest and most vibrant cities in all of Equestria! Isn't this  exciting?! [squeals] Applejack: Seems a hair odd, though, don't it? Map callin' me to a big city like <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>? Twilight Sparkle: You may be more of a country pony at  heart, Applejack, but the map picked you two because you're the best  ponies to tackle this particular mission  Applejack: But how will we even know what our mission's  supposed to be? That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as  all of Ponyville  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Pff  Kch  Ts! More like three times! Why,  it's not only home to the Haypacking District – it's also home to the  Fashion District! [to Twilight] Hmm  Shame you weren't called as well,  though, darling  You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of  <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> on our last visit  Twilight Sparkle: It's such an exciting city, and  there's still so much I'd like to do there  So many museums and  historical landmarks to visit  Not to mention all the libraries! But  this is your mission  Heh-heh  Don't worry about me  I've got plenty of    books    to keep me    busy  Spike: [scoffs] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> and Applejack: Mm-hmm  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] I just remembered something! The Sisterhooves Social! Applejack: We'll have to miss it  No tellin' how long we'll be in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>  I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset  [train chugging] [city noises] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>, what you do to me! Applejack: [gulps] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Darling, are you all right? Applejack: Ponies move so fast here  Not at all like back home  [to herself] Eyes peeled, ears open  Eyes peeled, ears open  "Rivet": [blows police whistle] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now  No moseying  You've gotta walk with speed and confidence! "Rivet": [blows police whistle] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Yoo-hoo! Applejack: [snorts] Diamond Cutter: Move it! Applejack: Sorry 'bout that  Strawberry Ice: Ah, get outta my way! Applejack: Sorry  Pedestrian Ponies 3 & 4: Watch it! Applejack: Hey— Oh, dear  Butter my biscuits  I can barely cross the street in this town  How am I supposed to help solve a— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] There! "Pearmain Worcester": Yes, I think this is the one  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: No! No  "Pearmain Worcester": Excuse me? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: That hat clashes with your mane, not to mention  it's far too large and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision  Oh, dear,  none of these will do  Oh, Applejack! What good timing! [bonk] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [humming] Here  This will do splendidly  "Pearmain Worcester": Oh, it's lovely! How much would you like for it? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, no-no, please, please, keep it  I can always make another  "Pearmain Worcester": Thank you! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [to Applejack] And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here! Pff  Kch  Ts! Applejack: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: What? We just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion  [beat] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Well, she could've been meeting a friend who  would've laughed at her new hat, and then their friendship could've been  ruined forever! And    mmm    it's possible  Applejack: Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Ye— No  I suppose it didn't  Still, a disaster was averted! Stinky Bottom: Averted? You just lost me a paying customer! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, my! Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry  I never meant to— Stinky Bottom: Beat it! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the  misunderstanding, and might I add, what a lovely establishment you have  here! [nervous laugh] [clears throat] You're right, Applejack  [sighs]  The search continues  Applejack: Uh, 'scuse me, I was just wonderin'    Uh,  friendship problem, anypony? See, we've been sent here to    A-A map  summoned us and, uh    If you could just take a moment to    <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Friendship advice! Anypony looking for friendship advice! Good grief  This isn't working  Applejack: [sighs] I'm not sure what we're supposed to do  To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, try not to worry, Applejack  The map picked  us for a reason  Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I  haven't a clue  We can't possibly approach every single pony in town  until we find out what we're meant to d—ooh! [reading] "Please help us  restore our long-lost but beloved tradition, the Midsummer Theater  Revival  There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the  Method Mares, as well as games, food, and much, much more  This event  promises to bring our Bronclyn neighbors together and restore our sense  of community, but there's so much to do and we need your help " Huh   [gasps] Darling, this is it! The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel! Applejack: Oh, right! She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Don't you see?! This must be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried! Applejack: Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into    that is, if we can ever get off this street corner  Coco Pommel: I can't believe you found my flyer  Quite a coincidence, don't you think? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Applejack and I were specifically summoned here  to be of service, and you, my dear friend, are in need of help  It's no  coincidence, darling  It's fate! [drinks] Applejack: [gulps] This Midsummer Theater Revival – what is it, exactly? [chews] Coco Pommel: An outdoor play held at the community park   Many moons ago, local theater troupes would perform, and ponies in the  neighborhood would help make the costumes and design set pieces, prepare  food to share during the performance  Applejack: Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company  Kinda reminds me of Ponyville  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: It sounds lovely, darling  Coco Pommel: It was, up until several moons ago  Applejack: What happened? Coco Pommel: That's Charity Kindheart  She was a  well-known costume designer on Bridleway  She started the Midsummer  Theater Revival as a way to share her passion for theater with the  neighborhood  No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the  Revival  [book shuts] Coco Pommel: But when she moved away to be closer to her  grandfillies, the neighborhood lost the special tradition she had  started, and worse, the sense of community it fostered  Street Pony: Hey, I'm trotting here! Applejack: Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity? Coco Pommel: I've been trying to  But I've just  gotten a last-minute request to alter costumes for the cast of My Fair  Filly, and I'm afraid I haven't made much progress  Oh    There's just  so much to do to bring back the Midsummer Revival, and my flyers haven't  attracted a single volunteer! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Say no more! You finish up your work, and by  this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend  a hoof  Applejack and I will make sure of it! Coco Pommel: You will? Applejack: You bet your boots we will! Coco Pommel: Oh, I don't wear boots  I find they chafe my calves when I walk  Applejack: It's just an expression  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation  "Fine Print": Yeah, not a good time right now  Heh  What am I saying? It's never a good time! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [clearing throat] Well? What do you think? "Chock-full Carafe": I got my own problems  You think I've got hours to dedicate to somepony else's? "Uptown Clover": Ah, yes, Charity's Midsummer Theater Revival  Such wonderful memories  Applejack: So you'll help us? "Uptown Clover": Oh, [laughs], don't be ridiculous  I  run a very important oat and hay import/export business  Why, I can't  spare even a moment for such things! [splash] [ducks quacking] Coco Pommel: This is a nightmare  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, not at all, darling  It's quite lovely  Applejack: I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival  Coco Pommel: I finished the alterations for My Fair  Filly, but I've barely started the costumes for the Revival, and the  Method Mares are coming to the park tomorrow for a costume fitting and  rehearsal! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Well, I could help you with the costumes  Coco Pommel: But what are we going to do about the rest? The park is in desperate need of repairs, and the sets still need to be built! Applejack: Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and  fixin' things  It's kinda, well, my thing  Could be the reason the map  called me here! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here  Applejack: Uh-huh  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle  Everything is going to be just fine! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Perhaps I spoke too soon    Coco Pommel: Oh, dear, you're right  Are you sure you can manage this by yourself? Applejack: Well, there's a lot to do, but <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>'s  right  The map wouldn't have called us here if we weren't up for the  challenge  You two go on and take care of the costumes  I'll see you at  the dress rehearsal  [gulps] [plants snapping] [lawn trimmer whirring] [shredding] [plant snapping] [crunch] [crash] [crunch] Applejack: I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can  [splat] [clang] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time  Everything's going to be— On Stage: Um, excuse me? Is this where the Midsummer Theater Revival is supposed to be, perchance? Raspberry Beret: We're here for the dress rehearsal? Coco Pommel: Oh, yes! We've just put the finishing touches on the costumes  "Late Show": [to Stardom] At least those look professional  Raspberry Beret: We'll do a dry run of the play first, and then the fitting  Applejack: No, wait! I haven't gotten a chance to— [wood crunching] Raspberry Beret: [yelps] [crash] Applejack:    reinforce the stage yet  Coco Pommel: [sighs] I just wanted to live up to  Charity's example, to bring my neighborhood together again  But the park  is still a mess, we haven't even thought about what refreshments to  serve during the performance, and even if we had, we don't have a stage  for the Method Mares to perform on! It's hopeless    Just hopeless! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [hushed] I don't understand  The map summoned us  here to solve a friendship problem  We've clearly found it, but why did  it send the two of us? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant! Applejack: I've been thinkin' the same thing  I mean, I  can at least see why you're here – Coco's your friend, and you have an  eye for costumes and all – but me? I was never gonna be able to finish a  project this big  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [dramatically] We'll return to Ponyville as failures! Why must this be, Applejack? Why? Why?! Wh— Applejack: Now hold on there  I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [muffled] Then what are you suggesting— [ptoo] Then what are you suggesting? Applejack: I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can   I think I've got a plan  It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll  be somethin'  And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right? Coco Pommel: I suppose so    Applejack: That's the spirit! Sorta    [hammering] Applejack: Alright, y'all, it's ready! On Stage: Should we go ahead and start? [curtains open] Raspberry Beret: [as Charity Kindheart] Excuse me  I'm  Charity Kindheart  I'm here about the open design position  I brought  some samples of my work  I'm sorry I'm late  I had the hardest time  finding my way here  [tearing up] I just moved here, and I keep getting  mixed up by the street names! I had a map, but I dropped it in a puddle,  which only made the street names harder to read! On Stage: I see  "Cloudy Daze": What is that? Blueberry Curls: I dunno, sugar, looks like some kinda play  "Cloudy Daze": Well, can we stay and watch it please? Please, can we, can we? Blueberry Curls: Oh, alright, I suppose we could stay for a minute  "Late Show": Excuse me, but your next appointment is here  On Stage: Alright  Send him in  [to Raspberry Beret] I'm  sorry, but based on these samples, I just don't think this is the place  for you  Raspberry Beret: [gasps dramatically] On Stage: Don't get me wrong  These clothes are all  exquisite and well-made, but more theatrical than avant-garde  Have you  considered costume design? I have a contact on Bridleway! If you're  interested, I can put you in touch with him     And scene  [curtains close] [ponies muttering] [curtains open] "Stardom": Charity, dear, is that you? Raspberry Beret: Hello, Mrs  Pearblossom! I didn't see—oops! "Stardom": Oh, let me help you, dear  Are these the costumes you've been working on? Raspberry Beret: Yes, I was supposed to be finished by  now, but there's just so much to do, and I still have a few last-minute  alterations to make before opening night! I'm sorry I couldn't get  enough tickets for everypony in the neighborhood  I hope Mr  Pearblossom  wasn't too disappointed  I know Trotter on the Roof is one of his favorites  "Stardom": Oh, my dear filly, don't worry about that  We're so proud of you  We shall be with you in spirit! Raspberry Beret: Thank you! You've all made me feel so  welcome here and have become like family to me! I just wish I could  share this experience with you and the others! "Rivet": Eh, what's goin' on? Luckette: It's the Midsummer Theater Revival  The Method Mares are performing! "Rivet": [sighs] The Revival  Mhm, yeah  My pop used to bring me  "Stardom": So nice of you to put on this play for the neighborhood  Raspberry Beret: I couldn't have done it without everypony's help! I know it's not Bridleway, but— "Stardom": Oh, pish-tosh! It's perfect, dear! Strawberry Ice: [eating popcorn] Pearly Stitch: Oh, you're such a dear, thank you! This is so nice  Haven't seen the neighborhood this friendly since Charity moved away! [audience clapping and cheering] On Stage: Thank you, fillies and gentlecolts  Please  give a warm welcome to the one who made this entire event possible – our  neighbor Coco Pommel! [audience clapping and cheering] Coco Pommel: [clears throat] Thank you all so much for  coming  The Midsummer Theater Revival was always something that meant so  much to me, and it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well  I  really can't take all the credit, though  My dear friends <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> and  Applejack helped me ever so much  [audience clapping and cheering] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes  Applejack: Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a  hammer is all  To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start  When  those fell through, we decided to simplify  This here was the result  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, don't be so modest  Coco and I were lost  Coco Pommel: You bet your boots we were! [general chatter] "Viola": We just wanted to say how much we enjoyed the Midsummer Theater Revival and how much it inspired us! Applejack: Oh, yeah? "Uptown Clover": I used to think that to help my  community I had to do something big  Heh-heh  And let's face it – in  this day and age, who has the time for such a commitment? But here, you  did something as simple as building a stage and putting on a play and,  heh, look at how it's brought everypony together  "Viola": I saw Coco's flyers for volunteers but didn't  think anything I'd have time to do would be that useful  Now I wish I'd  offered to help, even if it was just pulling a few weeds or planting a  few flowers  Applejack: Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far  from bein' fixed up  I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's  lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for  the better  "Viola": And I will! "Uptown Clover": And I don't think we'll be alone! [cutie marks ringing] Applejack: Yee-hoo! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> and Applejack: [laughing] Applejack: We did it! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] I understand now! It all makes perfect sense! Applejack: Huh? [thunk] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I know why the map called you here  Applejack: You do? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park,  it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>  ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community!  But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed  them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference! Applejack: Well, I'll be! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Seems you have more in common with the <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> ponies than you thought! Applejack: Heh-heh  But all the same, I'd sure like to  head back to Ponyville on the next train  I want to check in with Apple  Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, absolutely, my dear  Just as soon as I stop  that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous  scarf! Stop! You're making a terrible mistake! Applejack: [sighs] [Applejack's montage music over credits]			<br>

Prim Hemline: Miss <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>, how is it that all your competitors are here half an hour early, and yet you arrive seconds before we begin? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Uhhhh    [chuckles nervously] Just    lucky, I guess  Prim Hemline: Once we're done here, you're to finish setting up backstage, so you'll be ready for your run-through appointment  You  show your designs last  We keep to a precise schedule, so let's try to  be more than a few seconds early, hmm? Tomorrow is the contest to see  which one of you gets to stay to meet top designers all across the city   The rest of you must go home early  So sad  Dismissed! Suri Polomare: [chuckles] I'm so glad you made it, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out! Suri Polomare: Don't you remember me? Suri Polomare from the Ponyville Knitters League? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, yes, of course, of course! I– I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it  You haven't been back in years! Suri Polomare: Because I moved here to make it in the big city  [laughs], okay? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, good for you, Sur— Suri Polomare: Ooh, it's so good to see you! And now here we are, competing! [laughs], okay? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Yes, yes  Well, good luck! Suri Polomare: Oh, I don't need luck  Would you like a hoof with your things? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Why, thank you so much! Suri Polomare: My, your collection is gorgeous! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so! Suri Polomare: It's alright, but nothing like this!  Take my culottes, for example – they are simply crying out for just the  right accent, but I haven't the slightest notion where I— [gasps]  Actually    just a touch of this fabric could be perfect with it  W– Oh,  hey, would you mind terribly if I took a swatch? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, not at all! Here, I have loads extra  Suri Polomare: You're sure? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Positive! Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting  caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my  preparations and I am a bit late as it    is? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Hello! I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes! Janine Manewitz: Get in line over there  Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous, did you make that yourself? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, why, yes  It's stretchy, but not clingy  Shimmery— Suri Polomare: [simultaneously] Shimmery, but not showy   And the entire line is in the same adorable pattern  It works on  everything from skirts to tops to shoes and, [chuckles]    Prim Hemline: Oh, bravo! I've never seen anything like it! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: You stole my fabric! Suri Polomare: [laughs] I didn't steal it, okay? You gave it to me, 'member? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I gave you the fabric for accents! Not for your whole line! And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?! Suri Polomare: Fast? Hah! Coco Pommel here took practically forever  Nearly got me completely disqualified  Coco Pommel: Well, I wanted to make sure you'd win, so I took the extra time to— Suri Polomare: Quiet! I pay an assistant to sew and get coffee, not talk  'Kay? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] How could this happen? Suri Polomare: Aw, sweetie, don't blame yourself  It  takes some small-town fillies a while to learn it's everypony for  herself in the big city, m'kay? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [crying] Suri Polomare: Hope you realize how fortunate you are to have me as a mentor  Now get me some coffee! Twilight Sparkle: Oh, my gosh, what a great afternoon! That was almost too much fun! Rainbow Dash: Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed! Applejack: First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done  Pinkie Pie: Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern! Fluttershy: And after that    Main cast sans Spike: Hinny of the Hills! [laughing] Rainbow Dash: Is    everything okay? Pinkie Pie: You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [bawls] Rainbow Dash: But he said he brought them  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [crying] And then Suri stole them! [fast  breathing] I let one of the other contestants use some of my  one-of-a-kind fabric [fast breathing] and then she turned it into a  wardrobe just like mine, [fast breathing] only now it looks like I'm the one copying her! My generosity has ruined me, I tell you! Ruined! [bawls] Twilight Sparkle: Now, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>, whatever went wrong, we're all here to help you get through it, no matter what it takes  Rest of main cast sans <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [general agreement] Applejack: Come on, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>, buck up! All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] This new line is going to be marvelous!  Perhaps even better than the last! It's daring, it's bold! Perhaps I  still have a chance after all! [sewing machines whirring] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there! Twilight Sparkle: You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Don't fret  It'll be here in an hour  That's not going to be a problem, is it? Rainbow Dash: Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then    <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets  for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour  of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight!  And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without  any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! "Oh, why look,  there's our friend <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> going down in flames! Isn't friendship magic?!" Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>, calm down  What's gotten into you? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: What's gotten into you?! Oh, go ahead!  See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've  all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town! [door slams] [sewing machines whirring] [clicking] Twilight Sparkle: There  That's the last of them  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] Finally! Twilight Sparkle: You're welcome! Prim Hemline: Let's have another round of applause for Suri Polomare's amazing collection  [ponies cheering] Prim Hemline: That fabric! So original! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [sighs] Suri Polomare: [chuckles] Well look who's here  Here to show off your copycat collection, mm? Heh  Prim Hemline: And now, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> from Ponyville with her brand new line – and I mean "brand new" – Hotel Chic  [ponies talking excitedly] [cameras clicking] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh! They're liking it! I think I may have just  won this thing! Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with    My friends  They  didn't come  What have I done? [ponies cheering] [cameras clicking] Prim Hemline: <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>, they all adore you! Aren't you going to tell them about your fabulous pieces? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I have to go  Prim Hemline: [gasps] Come back at once! [audience gasps] Prim Hemline: This is unheard of! "Luggage Cart": How do you do, ma'am? Contest going well? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: No time to talk  I have to find my friends! "Luggage Cart": Oh, uh, they're gone already  I saw them headed out this morning  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, no! Back to Ponyville, I imagine  Oh, they  worked so hard on my behalf! And I repaid them with unkindness  What  have I done?! Oh    here you are  "Luggage Cart": But miss, I– I didn't do anything! [thunder rumbling] [<span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>] Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>, what have I done? The thought of Fashion Week was fun But I went way too far My friends gave to me in ways so kind And I gave them nothing but a hard time And now alone I stand And now alone I stand  [bell rings] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I need a moment with Prim Hemline  I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first for— Suri Polomare: Uh-uh-uh, you'd best steer clear of Prim for a while  She's pretty furious  Isn't that right? Coco Pommel: Um    yes  Pinkie Pie: [squee] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: There you all are! I can't believe it, I thought you went back home! Twilight Sparkle: We missed the show because we overslept  Suri told us you lost  I'm really sorry  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I lost? You know what? I don't even care  I'm  just happy you're all still here after how I treated you  Taking  advantage of your friendship the way I did  How could you ever see past  it? Applejack: Yeah, you were pretty rotten  Rainbow Dash: Wow, Applejack  I know your thing is honesty, but come on! Twilight Sparkle: Last night we may not have seen you at  your best, but we know you  And we would never let one thing like that  change how we feel about you  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, thank you! You really are the most wonderful  friends a pony could have! You know, I already arranged to make it up  to you this afternoon! Hope you're all available for an exclusive  performance of Hinny of the Hills! Rest of main cast: [cheering] Suri Polomare: And that is how it's done  Pretty  clever how I convinced her to stay away from Prim, wasn't it? [chuckles]  Wouldn't have wanted her to find out the truth now, would we? Hinny of the Hills: [singing] And I'm a dancing pony! Main cast: [cheering] Applejack: Wow! That was even better than I imagined! Rainbow Dash: I loved it! [beat] Uh, I mean, it was a'ight  Applejack and Pinkie Pie: [laughing] Twilight Sparkle: How did you ever get them to agree to do an extra performance just for us? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets? Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show! Fluttershy: Um, here in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Well, um    yes    it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while  Rest of main cast: [sighs] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: But I so wanted you to see this show! And working for this designer is such a great opportunity! Applejack: We know  We're happy for you, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>  We're just sad for us  Coco Pommel: Mind if I join you? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Sure  Come on down  This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week  [gasps] With my name on it! But I thought I lost! Coco Pommel: You didn't  You won  Suri was hoping that  if you didn't claim your prize, the judges would consider it a forfeit  and first place would go to her  So she lied to make you and your  friends go away, and, well, I lied too  I've worked for Suri for so  long, I started to believe that it really is everypony for herself in  this town  Until I saw how generous you were with your friends and how  generous they were with you  It made me start believing  there was something better for me out there  So, I– I quit  I brought  you something to say thank you  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Hm  I suppose you'll need a job now that you're  no longer with Suri  How would you like to work for my friend making all  the costumes for his next show? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> was simply grand  It was in this  magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who  will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit  Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends  [credits]			<br>

Why doesn't your face look like this?! Eee    <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip  for me  I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my  new shop  And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the– [gasps] [suddenly excited] energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria! [doors open] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [sighs] This city's simply a-ma-zing! It's just    everything, ever! Pinkie Pie: And it's about to get everything ever-er! Because guess who I see! M-A-U-D! You know what that spells? Maud Pie: [deadpan] It spells Maud  Pinkie Pie: [squee] [party cannon fires] Pinkie Pie: Maud, Maud, Maud! Yay! [theme song] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest  family traditions! Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with  each of your sisters? Pinkie Pie: Yep! I do separate trips with each one, and  we make it super fun by picking a different location every year! We see  the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset! And since Maud's  getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot  for PSSSD! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [hushed] Okay, what's the secret? Pinkie Pie: Huh? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: You just said 'pssst'  Pinkie Pie: No, silly! Not pssst, PSSSD! P-S-S-S-D! Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day! [stallion snorts] Pinkie Pie: [giggles nervously] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Maud! Maud Pie: [deadpan] Boulder promised his cousin a postcard  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD  And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique! Pinkie Pie: Before you go, can I ask you a quick question? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, of course  Pinkie Pie: [loudly] Will you please help me?! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [nervously] Only if you let go of my leg and stand up    Pinkie Pie: Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows  mine away! But this year is going to be different! For the first time,  I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets  me! There's a specialty store here in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> that sells nothing but  rock pouches! A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know  Maud will love it! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud! Pinkie Pie: I know, right? Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud  without ruining the surprise    Well, luckily for you, I know exactly  what you should do! Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the  pouch store? That way Maud won't get suspicious! I'll come with you to  distract Maud, so    Pinkie Pie:    I can sneak away to pick out a rock  pouch! [gasps] And if you're coming with us, you can look at boutique  locations along the way! [shouting] It's the perfect plan! [echoes out] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud  Pinkie Pie: Of course  Got it  Absolutely  Maud Pie: [deadpan] Nothing moved him  Pinkie Pie: Maud! I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever! [party cannon fires] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, what a spectacular view! You really can see everything from here! Maud Pie: [deadpan] Especially the glaciation of the sloping strata  It's breathtaking  Pinkie Pie: But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you! [party cannon fires] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I-It certainly is– [grunts] –cozy    but this simply won't do! Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind! Pinkie Pie: Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her! [party cannon fires] [skating sounds] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [inhales] Pinkie Pie: Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud! [party cannon fires] Maud Pie: [deadpan] You'll be pleased with yours too  [drawing noises] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Pinkie, put down that crayon! The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant! Pinkie Pie: [spits] [splash] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh    A pony could get used to eating at places like this! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I know  It's the only restaurant in the city with nepheline syenite in their bathroom tiles  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [stutters]    Well, isn't that something!  [deliberately] You know what, Pinkie Pie? Uh, maybe you could help me  figure out what to order! Pinkie Pie: [hushed] We're so close to the pouch store!  It's just a block away! I could practically smell it from here! If I  knew what a pouch store smelled like  [beat] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [hushed] Okay, remember the plan  I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch! Pinkie Pie: [hushed] Gotcha! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [deliberately] Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie  And now I know exactly what to order  Pinkie Pie: [deliberately] You are very welcome, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>! Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves! [thump] Pinkie Pie: Sorry! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: So, Maud    that Boulder of yours is such an  interesting    ahem    character  You must tell me, how did the two of  you first meet? Maud Pie: [deadpan] It was a dark and stormy night  Little did I know that my life was about to change forever  [cash register rings] Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud will love it! I need it! [crash] Pinkie Pie: Ungh! Huh, must be stuck! [reading] "Took a  sudden vacation to Canterlot with my grandniece  Back in a few moons "  Oh, no  Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no! Well, maybe, just maybe, he's already  back from vacation and just forgot to take the sign down! [shouting and  pounding on door] Hello, Mr  Pouch Store Owner! I'd like to hear all  about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while  buying a pouch for my sister please! Deputy Copper: Miss, the store's clearly closed  Pinkie Pie: But it can't be  It just can't be! If I  can't get that pouch    then not only am I not getting my sister the  greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD  present for my sister at all! [door opens] Maud Pie: [deadpan]    and Boulder's been by my side ever since  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [deadpan] Wow  What a surprisingly suspenseful  and compelling story  I completely get what you see in him now  [gasps]  Pinkie Pie, you're back! [deliberately] Oh, your hooves must be  sparkling clean! Pinkie Pie: Huh? Oh, right  [sighs] [beat] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Garçon! One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat! [thump] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: What happened? Did you get a pouch for Maud? Tell me everything! Pinkie Pie: [inhales] [quickly] The door to the rock  pouch store is locked because the owner's on a sudden vacation to  Canterlot with his grandniece for a few moons, and so there's no way I  can get the perfect present for Maud, and now I don't have any present  for her at all, so it'll be the worst Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day  ever! [inhales] [splat] Pinkie Pie: [muffled sobbing] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, not to worry, dear! I'll just have to help  you find a new present for Maud  We have plenty of time before your gift  exchange at sunset and all of <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> to explore  We're bound to  find something Maud would like  Maybe even more than a rock pouch! Pinkie Pie: You're right! Thanks, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>! [My Little Pony theme on piano interrupted by upwards glissando] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at  that marvelous giraffe  I was just wondering, any chance you could see  yourself with it? Maud Pie: [deadpan] Only if I had a mirror  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so  get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in  all of <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>! Surely there must be something here that catches your  eye  Maud Pie: [deadpan] [hushed] Boulder says they're all too    stuck-up  [Western-themed music] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [whistles] All right  You and me, Maud, you and  me  What do you think about    this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this?  Or this? Or this? This? This? This? This? This? [repeats, accelerating  into gibberish] Maud Pie: [deadpan] I like    that  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: What is it? You have to tell me! Was it this bike? This lamp? This grappling hook? What do you like?! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I like that fissure in the sidewalk  It's an elegant example of thermal expansion and soil settlement  [camera flashes] [sound of kettle boiling] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil   ? What?! But I   ! All of this   ! And she likes a crack?! [pop] Pinkie Pie: Did she like anything? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [hushed] That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for! There's nothing she needs or wants! Maud Pie: [deadpan] [calling out] Boulder  Boulder   Where'd you run off to? There you are  Sure wish I had something to  carry you around in  Pinkie Pie: A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud!  Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window! It had  double stitching, a red drawstring    <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>:    and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams? Pinkie Pie: Yep, that's the pouch  [beat] Wait, how'd you know? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Because I'm looking at one just like it! Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask— [zoom] Pinkie Pie: Excuse me, sir! I couldn't help but notice  your nifty rock pouch! Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with  it? I really need it  Like, really really really! "Street Rat": So lemme get this straight: You, uh, really really need this pouch, huh? Pinkie Pie: I believe I said really really really  "Street Rat": Well, you know, pouches like this are  really hard to come by these days  But I might be able to part with it  for the right price  Pinkie Pie: So you'll sell it to me? And I'll finally be  able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day  present? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! [party cannon fires] "Street Rat": Hmmm  That's one sweet party cannon you  got there  Tell you what  I'd be more than happy to give you the pouch  for the low, low price of    that cannon  Pinkie Pie: [gasps] M-My    party cannon   ? "Street Rat": Well, if you really wanna give that sister  of yours the perfect present, then you'll have to give up your party  cannon  So, what do you say? The pouch for the cannon  [ding] Maud Pie: [deadpan] Do you see the exposed chalcedony in the fissure? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Probably? Pinkie Pie: [despondent] What you guys lookin' at? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, you're back! [to Maud] Darling, I want to  get one more picture of you with that astounding fissure in the  sidewalk, and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot! Uh,  be a dear and go stand behind it  Okay, now just, uh, back up a little  bit! Little more! And now just a little    uh    twenty yards more!  Perfect! Hold that pose! I think we found your new holiday card!  [hushed, to Pinkie] So, how did it go? Tell me, tell me, tell me! Pinkie Pie: [despondent] Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and    that's really the only thing that matters  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, I am so glad to hear that! She's going to absolutely love it! Pinkie Pie: [despondent] Yup  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: "Yup"? That's it? You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is "yup"? Pinkie Pie: [despondent] Yup  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: But    you're Pinkie Pie  You're supposed to be  all [quickly] "Oh, I'm so excited I bought the rock pouch! And I know I  say excited a lot when I'm actually just kind of excited, but this time I'm really  excited about how excited I am about being this excited over the rock  pouch!" [normally] And then you fire off your party cannon  Say, where  is your cannon? [gasps] Did you lose it? Is your party cannon lost  somewhere in the big city?! Pinkie Pie: [despondent] Well    I wouldn't say it's lost  I mean, I know where it is  It's just    [sighs] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I can clearly see that something's bothering  you, and I want to help  But I can't help you unless you tell me what  the problem is  Pinkie Pie: [despondent] Oh, there's no problem  It just  turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> is one  party cannon  Who knew? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: You gave away your cannon?! But, but that  party cannon is your everything! You absolutely love that cannon! How  could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?! Pinkie Pie: Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Well, I guess I understand    maybe  Pinkie Pie: Maud's going to be so excited  I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I know, the camera loves Boulder  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: After the day we've had, I'm probably looking  forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more  than the two of you! [giggles] And I'm not even a Pie sister! I can't  wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each  other! Pinkie Pie: Well, you're going to have to  We don't just  swap, silly  We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song  first! Ready, Maud? Maud Pie: [deadpan] As I'll ever be  [Pinkie Pie] It's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong!  Maud Pie: [deadpan] Hey  Pinkie Pie: Okay, time to swap presents! Hmmmm  [licks] [beat] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [growls] Just open them already! [paper ripping] Maud Pie: [deadpan] Thanks  Pinkie Pie: I knew you'd love it! It was all worth it!  Look how happy she is! And I couldn't have done it without you  Thank  you, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>  Okay! Time to open your present to me! Oh! You did it  again! You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD! This is  perfect! This is amazing! This is incredible! I love it, I love it, I  love it! [beat] What is it? Maud Pie: [deadpan] It's little pieces of cupcake-scented paper  You know, confetti  For your cannon  Pinkie Pie: Maud    [sniffs] You know me so well  You  really are the most thoughtful gift-giver in the world! I'm gonna love  it five-ever! That's even longer than for-ever  [sighs happily] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: You're right, that is impressive  But it's no fissure in the sidewalk  Maud Pie: [deadpan] [to Boulder] Play nice  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch  Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it  [gasps] Oh! Maud Pie: [deadpan] What? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I mean    forget I said that! I'm, I-I-I'm glad  to see that you like the pouch  You can remember that part  Just forget  the second part  You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie  had to give something up— [shrieks] Perhaps I should just stop talking  now  Nothing! Pinkie Pie: Hee-hee, yay! I love my sister and my new confetti! Maud Pie: [deadpan] Why isn't she using her party cannon? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Gahhhh    [dirt dragging noises] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [deliberately] Ooh! Wow, look how filthy my hooves are! I really should go wash them! Maud Pie: [deadpan] Where's her cannon? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: No, no, stop, stop giving me that look! I can't  take it! Nnnnn    [quickly] Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she  always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her! Maud Pie: [deadpan] What? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch! Maud Pie: [deadpan] She gave up her party cannon? Pinkie Pie: [blows confetti] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Pinkie Pie! You might want to come over here for a second! Pinkie Pie: I think I know what this is about  You guys wanna ride the swans  Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can ri— Maud Pie: [deadpan] You gave away your party cannon? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [inhales] She broke me  Pinkie Pie: Nnngh, it's just    It's just    It's just    You always give better gifts than me! That's why I had to get you the perfect gift! [beat] Are your hooves dirty? Where're you going?! Maud Pie: [deadpan] To get your cannon back  Maud Pie: [deadpan] There  Pinkie Pie: Yep! That sure is the pony I got the pouch from! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: That's amazing! How did you know where he'd be? Maud Pie: [deadpan] Maud Sense  Pinkie Pie: Runs in the family! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please  "Street Rat": Sorry, missy, all sales are final  Maud Pie: [deadpan] [slightly more forcefully] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Ooh, I've never seen her like this! Look at the fire in her eyes! You'd better do what she says! "Street Rat": Fire in her eyes? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh! Did she just clench her jaw?! I think she clenched her jaw! "Street Rat": I didn't see  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, no! When she clenches her jaw    you know what that means?! "Street Rat": What? What's it mean? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Trust me, you do not want to know! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch  "Street Rat": [whimpering] Here! Take it, take it, please! Just relax that jaw of yours and turn down that fire in your eyes! [whimpering] [skidding] Pinkie Pie: Maud! I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back! Yay! [party cannon fires] Pinkie Pie: Uh-oh  I just realized something  'Cause you  gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've  gotten me today! And it's something I really, really wanted! You did it  again! Your gifts are always better than mine! Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up and— Maud Pie: [deadpan] Pinkie, gift giving isn't a  competition  It's an expression of love, and you always make sure to  give your gifts with lots of love  That's why I'll always love them, and  you, five-ever  That's even longer than for-ever  Pinkie Pie: Awwww! [to <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>] There you are! You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time! We've got a train to catch here! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Voila! Welcome to the future home of "<span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> For  You"! What do you think of the place? Is this the right location? Did I  pick a good spot? Maud Pie: [deadpan] No  You picked the perfect spot  Pinkie Pie: You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever! But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Wait  PSSS-D-W-R? What's that? Pinkie Pie: P-S-S-S-D-W-R! It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with! Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day    Maud Pie: [deadpan] With <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh! Ohhh! Why, that's the sweetest    Oh, no   Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no  I know how good you two are at giving gifts! I'm  going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year  to do it! Pinkie Pie: Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>! It doesn't matter what you get us! As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [sighs] Why, thank you, Pinkie  Pinkie Pie: Buuuut now that you mention it    I could use more confetti for my party cannon  You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day!

Where is the darned  thing? [groans] I wish for once I'd remembered to label these boxes! Uh,  Big Mac, be a dear and help me move those    Uh, maybe it's in that one  on the bottom  [boxes creaking] [lid sliding] Granny Smith: Oh, dagnabbit, it's not in there either! Apple Bloom: [muffled laughing] [normal] You can't catch me! Applejack: [laughing] Woo-hoo! Apple Bloom: Hey! Applejack: [more laughing] You trickster! Granny Smith: Sisterhooves Social is right around the  corner  Thought it'd be nice to award the winner of the big race the  ribbon from when we hosted the very first Social! If'n of course I could  find the darn thing  Oh, would you looky here! My, how Apple Bloom used  to love watching you make that thing fly  It's like she thought you was  magic  Ah, right, enough reminiscin'  Gotta find that ribbon! If you  would just help me— [straining] pull    this    box, then maybe I can     Uh, Big Mac? [thump] Granny Smith: [straining] Found her! [theme song] Apple Bloom and Applejack: S-I-S-T-E-R-S! Which two sisters are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Applejack forever! Yee-hoo! Apple Bloom: We're gonna win every competition at the Sisterhooves Social! Those other fillies aren't gonna know what hit 'em! Applejack: Oh  Hey there, Big Mac! Did you want somethin'? Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Apple Bloom: Hold that thought  Applejack, you are the most awesome sister ever! Applejack: Aw, gee-whiz  [laughs]  Well I think it's sweet that you hold that opinion, but— Apple Bloom: It's not opinion! It's objective fact! You  saved Equestria like a gazillion times, you're smart, funny, strong     Why you're the best sister of all time! Probably the best Apple of all  time! Right, Big Mac? Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Apple Bloom: And with you by my side, I am guaranteed to taste sweet, sweet Sisterhooves Social victory! Go, Apples, go, go, go, Apples go! Applejack: Uh, Apple Bloom? I think Big Mac's got somethin' he wants to show you  [squeaking] [dragonfly toy spinning] [clicking] Apple Bloom: Oh, hey  Is that the toy we used to play with when I was little? Big McIntosh: Eeyup! Apple Bloom: Neat  [to Applejack] Alright then! Let's  get back to practicin'! One more run-through of our jugglin' routine,  make sure our harmonies are tight in our song, and see if we can't beat  our best pie-eatin' time! Applejack: Hold on, sugarcube  I need a minute to talk with Big Mac  Apple Bloom: Mind if I go ahead and start eatin' this pie?! [splat] [hammer clanging on anvil] Applejack: Hey, Big Mac, you all right? Big McIntosh: [sighs] Yup  Applejack: You sure? You seemed a little down back there  Big McIntosh: [scoffs] Nope  Applejack: Come on, you can tell me  You feelin' a  little left out? Apple Bloom and I have been spendin' a lot of time  together gettin' ready for the Social  [cutie mark pulsing] Applejack: [gasps] What in the   ? Apple Bloom: Your cutie mark! You're being summoned, Applejack! This is so cool! Big McIntosh: [sighs] Eeyup  Apple Bloom: Wonder where you're bein' called to  Wonder  what you're supposed to do when you get there  Obviously to somethin'  awesome because you're awesome! But    But if you're bein'  summoned to solve a friendship problem, that means you'll have to miss  the Sisterhooves Social! And if you have to miss the Social, then I'll have to miss the Social, which means I won't be able to taste sweet, sweet victory! [hyperventilating] Applejack: Now calm down  Let me just go over to Twilight's castle and see what's what! Maybe it's just a false alarm  Apple Bloom: But you said it was a false alarm! Applejack: I said maybe it's a false alarm  Well, it's not  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> and I have to go to <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>  Apple Bloom: Can't you just tell that map it'll have to wait a couple days? Applejack: No can do, sugarcube  When duty calls, I  gotta answer right away  What kind of an example would I be settin' for  my little sister if I didn't? Apple Bloom: This can't be happening! Your extreme awesomeness is backfiring on me! Applejack: [sighs] I'm sorry, Apple Bloom  [to Big Mac] Try and cheer her up, won't you? Big McIntosh: Eeyup  [triangle rattling] Granny Smith: Breakfast, come and get it! [splat] [poink poink] [plate rattling] Granny Smith: Oh, it's no use, Big Mac  If I know my Apple Bloom, she won't come out of a funk this funky 'til her big sister gets back  [knocking] Sweetie Belle: Hey, Apple Bloom, the Social's gonna start in a few hours  Thought you might want to go with us  Scootaloo: Since <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> and Applejack are out of town, you and Sweetie Belle can cheer on me and Rainbow Dash instead! Sweetie Belle: Pretty great they're letting you participate even though you're not technically sisters  Granny Smith: Well, the Social's always had a pretty  loose definition of what consti-ma-tutes a sister  As long as you share a  bond that represents the spirit of the Social, you're in! Sweetie Belle: So what do you say? Scootaloo: You coming? Apple Bloom: Why not   ? Got nothin' better to do    Lemme wash up and I'll meet you in a little bit  [thunk] Granny Smith: [sighs] Such a shame we don't live closer  to all your second cousins  You could maybe do the Social with one of  them instead  What is it, Big Mac? Y'all got an idea? Big McIntosh: Eeyup! Apple Bloom: What? What is it?! Scootaloo: Today is our big day! Rainbow Dash: We have so got this  I'm gonna go sign us in  Sweetie Belle: I guess I'm just a little jealous you two  get to compete and I don't  But at least I get to be here and cheer you  on! I thought Apple Bloom was gonna be here too  Scootaloo: Guess she changed her mind  Hey, there you are! You ready to cheer on me and Rainbow Dash to victory? Apple Bloom: Uh, not exactly  Seems I'm gonna get to participate after all  Sweetie Belle: [gasps] Applejack is back from <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> already? That must mean <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> is back too! Apple Bloom: No, our sisters are still gone  But it,  uh    turns out my long lost cousin    'Orchard Blossom' was able to  make it last minute  [nervous laugh] Sweetie Belle: Your cousin who what now? Big McIntosh: [as Orchard Blossom, falsetto] Well, I do declare! It's hotter today than the business end of a corncob pipe! [giggling] Big McIntosh: Oh, my! I'm so delighted to meet your little friends, Apple Bloom  Would these be your dear and beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders? Apple Bloom: [sighs] Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, cousin Orchard Blossom  Big McIntosh: It is my extra-ordinary pleasure to make your acquaintance  Sweetie Belle: [deadpan] That's Big Mac in a dress  Big McIntosh: Big Mac? Why, as charmed as I am that you find me  in the slightest resemblance to such a-a-a fine and noble product of  the Apple clan  I am astonished in equal measure  However, I shall take  this startling observation under advisement given that it's from such an  astute and perceptive filly as yourself, Sweetie Belle  Sweetie Belle: That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant  Big McIntosh: I haven't the slightest doubt  [scribbling] Big McIntosh:  Pardon me  My dearest cousin Applejack is regrettably unable to be here  as planned, so I, her cousin Orchard Blossom, will accompany Apple  Bloom in her stead  I trust that's acceptable to all concerned? Rainbow Dash: Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh? I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you  Big McIntosh: Why, you must be Rainbow Dash  You're Scootaloo's    say    how are y'all related again? Rainbow Dash: Hm  Why don't I just let you finish  signing in? [hushed] But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it  easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion! Big McIntosh: [laughs] Now, where were we? [crunch, crunch] Apple Bloom: Um, excuse me  I have to    go to the bathroom  [zip] Big McIntosh: [tuts] You mean 'powder your muzzle', don't you, dear? Such a more, uh, feminine-like reference to nature's call, don't you agree? Sweetie Belle: Have they called your brother's bluff yet? Apple Bloom: No, but they're about to! I can't bear to watch! Big McIntosh: Yoo-hoo! Apple Bloom! They've approved us as a pair! [giggles] Hurry along now, precious! Apple Bloom: I can't believe they bought it! Sweetie Belle: It's sweet he wants to help you out like this  Weird, but sweet  [ponies singing] Booth Barker: Bravo, bravo! Weren't those two sisters great? Now, where are our next competitors? Big McIntosh: Here we are! This one, please  Booth Barker: Excellent choice    ma'am  Apple Bloom: [hushed] You sure you know all the words? 'Cause it took Applejack a pretty long time to get it down  Big McIntosh: [hushed] Did it now? Apple Bloom: [gulp] [Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh] We all love our brothers And our fathers and mothers We honor them like every family should But there's somethin' that's quite unique When my sister's there with me And we share that special bond of sisterhood [Apple Bloom] Sisterhood [Big McIntosh] Sisterhood [Apple Bloom] Is a special kind of friend Sisterhood [Big McIntosh] Sisterhood [Apple Bloom] Is a bond that never ends [Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh] It's not always perfect You might fight or be misunderstood But together you'll always have sisterhood [Big McIntosh] Sisterhood [Apple Bloom] Sisterhood [Big McIntosh] Sisterhood [Apple Bloom] Sisterhood [Big McIntosh] Sisterhood [Apple Bloom] Sisterhood [Big McIntosh] [deep bass] Sisterhood! [Apple Bloom] [joining in]    ood [ponies chatter] Apple Bloom: [nervous laugh] Are you okay, cousin  Orchard Blossom? You sounded like you were catchin' a cold or somethin'  else that would make your voice sound totally different right at the end  of the song  [nervous laugh] Big McIntosh:  Just a frog in my throat, dear  Probably just need to get a sip of  water  If you'll excuse us, we've another event in which to participate   Oh, my, that certainly didn't go as I had planned  But don't you worry   We'll get you a blue ribbon yet, Apple Bloom  Apple Bloom: You sure about that? Big McIntosh: As sure as my name is cousin Orchard Blossom  Apple Bloom: [to herself] But that isn't your name! Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh as Orchard Blossom: C-O-U-S-I-N-S! Which two sis— uh, cousins are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Appleja— I mean, Orchardjack— Blossom forever! Big McIntosh: Whee! Apple Bloom: Whoaaa! [crash] [pop] Apple Bloom: [spits] Yay  [rope whooshing] [pins clunking] Big McIntosh:  Oh, I don't know why I didn't choose to wear something more casual   Why, I knew that juggling routine like the back of my hoof! But never  you mind  There is still the race to be run! Apple Bloom: I really appreciate all the effort, Big Ma—  cousin Orchard Blossom, but maybe we just skip the whole obstacle  course thing and call it a day  Big McIntosh: Why, Apple Bloom! I wouldn't hear of it! Your cousin Orchard Blossom may be many things, but she is not a quitter  Apple Bloom: I'm sure she's not, but it's like Applejack  said! There'll be more Sisterhooves Socials down the line, and I'm sure  she'll help me get a blue ribbon next time around  Big McIntosh: B-But you wanted to win it this Sisterhooves Social! And no matter what, I am gonna get you that win! Why, I simply have to  Rainbow Dash: Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play! Scootaloo: How could I forget? We've been training all week! Rainbow Dash: Okay, hot stuff! What's our move on the grape squish? Scootaloo: The alley-oop  Rainbow Dash: Apple toss? Scootaloo: Flip-flop  Rainbow Dash: Egg carrying? Scootaloo: Flutter-bomb  Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo: Yeah! Big McIntosh: Oh, dear  Granny Smith: [through megaphone] Competi-sis-tors! Take your positions! Big McIntosh: [snorts] Granny Smith: [through megaphone] And a-ready, and a-set, go! Rainbow Dash: Nice jump, Scoot! Big McIntosh: [yelp] [crunching] [crash] Apple Bloom: Woo-hoo! [chewing] Big McIntosh: [belches] [snap] Big McIntosh: [chewing] [belches] [grapes squishing] [falling whistle] [splash] Apple Bloom: Yikes! You almost squished me! [chickens panicking] Big McIntosh: Pick up those hooves, Apple Bloom! Why, you're barely movin' at a mosey! [crunch] Big McIntosh: Come on, junebug, it's    like you've never carried an egg before! Apple Bloom: Argh! I'm goin' as fast as I can! Big McIntosh: [anxious jittering] Apple Bloom: [yelps] [crunching] [ponies yelping] Apple Bloom: [screaming] Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo: [yelps] Big McIntosh: Woo-hoo! [beat] Big McIntosh: [coughs] I mean, [clears throat] victory is ours, sweet Apple Bloom! [ripping] [thunk] Big McIntosh: Uh-oh  Registration Pony: "Uh-oh" indeed! Apple Bloom: I should've known you'd eventually get busted for bein' a stallion! Registration Pony: Oh, no, we've known all along  The  Sisterhooves Social has always had a loose policy when it comes to what  counts as a "sister"  But we do have a strict policy when it comes to  sportsponyship! In your "sister's" desperation to win, he used brute  strength to physically take out the competitors  Uh, that kind of  behavior is not just unbecoming of a lady, but quite frankly, of  anypony! And for that, you two are hereby disqualified! Rainbow Dash: Hah! Looks like we win, squirt! Scootaloo: Woo-hoo! Yeah! [ponies cheering] Apple Bloom: I told you I should've just waited until the next Social to win with Applejack  Big McIntosh: [sighs] [balloon popping] Apple Bloom: You know I'm    not mad, right? Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Apple Bloom: I mean    let's face it – you dressin' up as my cousin Orchard Blossom was a pretty crazy idea in the first place  Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Apple Bloom: And it's not like you got me disqualified  from the Social forever or anythin'  I can participate next time with  Applejack  Everything's fine  Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Apple Bloom: I just don't understand why you went so  crazy there at the end of the race  I mean, I know you like to win an'  all, but    you wanna tell me what's goin' on? Big McIntosh: Nope  Apple Bloom: Alright  Well, it's getting late  You comin'? Big McIntosh: Nope  Apple Bloom: Okay  See you later, I guess    Big McIntosh: Apple Bloom? Apple Bloom: Yeah? Big McIntosh: When you were little, you used to look up  to me, thought I was the best thing since zap apple jam  Things are  different now  Applejack's the hero of the Apple family, always rushin'  off to save Equestria  And I'm just here on the farm, doin' chores,  helpin' out the way I can, nothin' special, nobody's hero  I guess I  just thought    oh, never mind  Here I am about to start blabberin' on  about my feelin's  You don't wanna hear all this  Apple Bloom: Yes, I do! Big McIntosh: I guess I just thought if I could    fill  in for Applejack at the Social and get you a blue ribbon, well, I could  be somepony you looked up to again  Be your hero again  Even if it was  for just a day  It was foolish and I'm ashamed  Please, I just wanna be  alone right now  Apple Bloom: Yeah, well, too bad, you big goof! 'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere   And I know that you're always gonna be here when I need you  Heck,  you'll do a whole obstacle course in high heels if you think it'll help  me get somethin' I want  You're my big brother  You've always been a  hero to me, Big Mac, and you always will be  I'm real sorry I haven't  been lettin' you know that's how I feel  Guess both of us have been  holdin' back when it comes to expressin' ourselves, huh? Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Granny Smith: Big Mac! Apple Bloom! Your sister's home! She says she's got quite a story to tell about her trip to <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>! Apple Bloom: Be there in a bit! I'm spending some quality time with my big brother! [to Big Mac] Hey, Big Mac? Big McIntosh: Eeyup? Apple Bloom: How do you think cousin Orchard Blossom would describe this sunset? Big McIntosh:  [chuckles] Why, dear, I do declare this is the most beautiful sunset my  eyes have ever looked upon  Though sitting here on these tree roots is a  trifle uncomfortable for my hindquarters  Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh: [laughing] [credits]			<br>

Rainbow Dash: Um, I have an idea  How 'bout we don't read it? Twilight Sparkle: What she means is, before you read it, we should probably tell you about— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: No, no, darling  Please, no spoilers  Fluttershy: But— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: No spoilers! [theme song] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a  stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of  you contributed to the successful opening of <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> For You?

Ms  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>, you've got  shops all over Equestria, but this was your first time trying to make it  in the big city  What made ya think you could tackle it on your own? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria  I  just have two other boutiques: one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one  in Canterlot  Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident  [bell dings] Twilight Sparkle: Let's just say that if I could choose, I probably wouldn't do it that way again  Heh  Pinkie Pie: Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever    Applejack: It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster! Rainbow Dash: After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right? [pencil writing] Rainbow Dash: Wait, are you writing this down?

[laughs] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Mr  Stripes owns the building  He's a very pleasant landlord  Although he can be pushy at times  [beat] Okay, all the time  Mr  Stripes: You've met my daughter, the apple of my ear, the hay in my hoof? You will let her work with you  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [chuckles nervously] It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see  Mr  Stripes: There are only two things I love more than  being pushy  One is my daughter  The other is miniature doll furniture   And I would sell my entire mini-furniture collection to make my daughter  happy  You understand? [poit, poit, poit] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I'm sorry  I just don't think it's going to be possible  Mr  Stripes: Let me say another way    Hire her or I raise rent until you no can afford! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, uh, welcome aboard  Plaid Stripes: [loudly] First idea! Instead of clothes, we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth! Like this  [chomp, chomp] But they glow in the dark! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Golly, what a splendid idea! [chuckles nervously] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Glow-in-the-dark teeth! What was she thinking?! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Aah! Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste! Fluttershy: Aw, hello  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: But what are they doing here? [raccoons chittering] Fluttershy: Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan  Fluttershy: Then Smoky Jr  found a nice home in the crawl  space behind the building  But Mr  Stripes demolished it, so they were  temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: No, no, no! I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique! [dance music playing, chandelier creaks] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Uh, did you hear that? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [annoyed] Heh  Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs  Pinkie Pie: [excitedly] Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs! [dance music continues] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I'm sorry  Could you please ask her to turn it  down? Could you ask her to turn it down, please? [pleading] Turn it  down, please! [sobbing] Oh, please! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Ugh! Foals today listen to their so-called  "music" far too loud  I realize that makes me sound like an old mare   But this is business! [sweeping] [dance music playing, chandelier creaking] Rainbow Dash: I wish we were having as much fun as they are  Twilight Sparkle: Well, sweeping can be fun, too  [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep  Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep    Rainbow Dash: Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping  I mean, how lame is that? Applejack: Yeah  It wasn't even catchy  Rainbow Dash: Nope  [hoof-bump] Twilight Sparkle: [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep    Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Applejack: [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep    <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her  [honk!] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?! Plaid Stripes: You know how most stores have a little  jingle-bell when the door opens? Ahem  I thought we should have  something with a little more pizzazz! So, I installed one of Daddy's  antique horns  [honk! honk! honk!] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [sighs] We'll have to do something about that,  after I think of a way to quiet down that music  And after I finish  designing the window display! [crash!] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Ahh! Wait, is this my merchandise shipment from Ponyville? It's completely disorganized! A—A—    [sighs] Coco Pommel: [sneezes] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see  you! Now, as the sole sales associate at <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> For You, I hate to add  to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as  though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought  Coco Pommel: Actually, I— [sneezes] I can't work tonight  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh? Why not? Coco Pommel: [blowing nose] Coco Pommel: [sneezes] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Feel better, my sweet  We'll manage without  you    somehow  And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and  disorganized clothes and dance music! Am I forgetting anything? [raccoons chittering] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [sobbing] What am I going to do?! Twilight Sparkle: Well, opening a store in <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> is a pretty big deal  It's natural that <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> would be a little stressed about how it was going  Since it wasn't going well  Still, I think she handled it all right  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: My dream is doomed! Doomed, I tell you! Doomed! Twilight Sparkle: I know things haven't gone perfectly so far, but we've done this kind of thing before  If we all work together— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: I appreciate the offer, but this is <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span>   To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect  The  perfect location! The perfect clothes! The perfect opening! Twilight Sparkle: Maybe we should just postpone  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Postpone?! Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season  If we don't open tonight, it won't be    Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Perfect  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Yes  I know what needs to be done  I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself! Pinkie Pie: Yeah    Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry  [syrup splashes] Twilight Sparkle: We can do this  And we can stay true to your vision  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: You'd do that? Fluttershy, you'll handle those    strong-smelling raccoons for me? Fluttershy: Of course  Applejack: Leave Plaid Stripes to me  I'll handle her and her, uh, "good ideas"  Pinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh, ooh! And I can go upstairs to that  nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party  cannons and— <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [clears throat] Pinkie Pie: And then make them be quiet  Twilight Sparkle: I'm pretty sure I know somepony who  wouldn't mind organizing this merchandise shipment for you  [beat] I'm  talking about myself  [beat] [pleading] Oh, please, let me organize it! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best  Rainbow Dash: Leave the hiring to me  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh! This is it, my dears  If you can handle  these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display   We'll show <span style="background-color:yellow">Manehattan</span> what <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> For You is all about! Oh, what would I  do without you? Rainbow Dash: What would she do without us? Huh  Lemme  think  [imitating <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>] "Darlings, I'm absolutely doomed, doomed,  doomed!" [laughs, normal voice] Heh, I sound just like her! [pencil scratching] Rainbow Dash: Hey, you're not writing this down, are you? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Now for the perfect window display  Hmm  [dance music playing] Pinkie Pie: Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?! Oh, what would <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> want?! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> Devil: Keep that party going 'til the break of dawn! Pinkie Pie: Really? <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> Angel: Indubitably! And as for the roof, get jiggy! Raise it, Pinkie! Raise it like you've never raised it before! Pinkie Pie: Oh! If you say so! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> Devil: Oh, please, Pinkie Pie  Never in a million years would I say such balderdash! [poof] [poof] Pinkie Pie: Oh  [screech] Pinkie Pie: Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest  of beats  I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music  straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene! [to DJ  Pon-3] I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think  [record scratches] [shopping music plays] Dancers: Awww  Rainbow Dash: <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> For You is only hiring the best of  the best  And to me, that means the fastest  Now, uh, before we begin,  uh    [to herself] Am I doing this right? What would <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> want? [to  applicants] New plan! [zip!] Rainbow Dash: Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is? Blue Bobbin: That's organza  Rainbow Dash: Are you sure? Blue Bobbin: It's a thin, plain weave  Sheer fabric traditionally made from silk, so    yeah  Rainbow Dash: I don't know the first thing about clothes   Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's  clothes or not  This chair? Not clothes  Plaid Stripes: See if you can keep up with me here  What are all clothes made of? Applejack: Uh, fabric? Plaid Stripes: Bingo! But not in this store  Uh-uh  Not anymore  Applejack: Oh, no? Plaid Stripes: Two words for you: "spoon clothes"  All our clothes will be made of spoons! Applejack: [sighs, to herself] What would <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> want?  [to Plaid Stripes] You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes  If it were up to  me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's  Discount Hat Emporium  But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no  Applejack: Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea  Useful, too  Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes  Twilight Sparkle: There  Perfect  Although, what would <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> want? Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color  Guess I have to start over! Fluttershy: Hello, Smoky, Softpad, Smoky Jr ? I have  some    interesting news  I, oh    I'd like you all to stay here  forever, but    [to herself] What would <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> want? [to the raccoons]  You have to move out! [sobs] [raccoons shriek] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: A window display is the first thing customers  see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory  that is my boutique  Rainbow Dash: [stammers] I don't know which one of you to hire! Just    keep guessing fabrics! Plaid Stripes: Daddy, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>'s friend doesn't like my ideas! Mr  Stripes: Spoon clothes is good idea! [dance music playing] Pinkie Pie: Oh, no! Not a shopping music mashup! [raccoons growling] Fluttershy: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! [knob jiggles] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] [slow motion sounds] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: How's it— [door slams] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Ooh! Fluttershy: When you write the story, could you maybe skip over the part where we locked <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> in the window display? [nervous chuckle] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Hello? The door appears to be stuck! Twilight Sparkle: Yep  We're workin' on it! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Hmm  Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste  [ponies chattering and raccoons chittering] Twilight Sparkle: How did this happen? Pinkie Pie: I shut down the party  Applejack: I told Plaid Stripes no  Fluttershy: I asked the raccoons to leave  Rainbow Dash: I asked a lot of fabric questions  Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash: Just like I thought <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> would want! Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> asked us to help her with  everything because she knows all of us so well  [to Fluttershy] She  knows how much you care for animals  She'd trust you to solve the  problem your way  [to the others] Maybe we should all do the same  Doing this our way is what <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> wants  It's not too late  Let's all dig in and we can fix this  [ponies chattering] Twilight Sparkle: Before <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> finds out how bad we messed up  Fluttershy: I'm sorry I asked you to leave  The place is yours if you wanna stay  Though I would like to ask you all just one favor  Pinkie Pie: I'm sorry I made you play that un-fun,  super-boring music  But if you're up for it, I have an idea to make the  party even better! Rainbow Dash: Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do  get speed  And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>'s gonna have  So    first one to the river and back gets the job!  [beat] It's a race! Go! Applejack: [clears throat] Mr  Stripes, I owe your  daughter an apology  She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a  chance  So here's what I'm thinkin'  [taxi rattling] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Perfect! [doorknob rattling] [door opens] [thump] Twilight Sparkle: [awkwardly] Wow, looks like we fixed that door just in time! <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [gasps] Oh! What's all this? Twilight Sparkle: The whole place organized by style,  cross-referenced by size, and reverse-indexed by fabric  She'll be able  to find anything in three seconds flat! It was some of my best work  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh! I knew I could count on you! All right    I suppose this is the moment of truth    [door opens, bell rings] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> For You is now open! [ponies chattering] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: Oh, dear  I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd  How will I handle them all? Blue Bobbin: My name's Blue Bobbin  I'll be your personal shopping assistant this evening  Rainbow Dash: Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out! Rainbow Dash: Honestly, they were all pretty slow  But  they finished the race  Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I  did  So, I hired them all! [music starts] Pinkie Pie: The way I see it, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats  What better combination than a boutique/dance club? Fluttershy: After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help! [splat] "Waxton": Ah, a blue corn reduction with shallot confit! But how can I possibly enjoy it without a— Plaid Stripes: Spoon? Applejack: Heh  Toldja spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea  "Waxton": [sips] Mmm! Exquisite! This is the most whimsical and wonderfully fashionable boutique I've ever seen! [ponies chattering] <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [reading] "In the end, <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>'s grand opening was  a smashing success! True, it got off to a rocky start, but somehow this  rag-tag group of ne'er-do-wells   " [to ponies] Oh, heavens, I think he  means you  [continues reading] "   came together and created the  perfect boutique  A vision of <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span> combined with the expertise of her  friends! This reporter, for one, is a believer " [to ponies] Why didn't  you tell me there were so many problems? Twilight Sparkle: We all figured you had enough on your mind  Applejack: And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect  <span style="background-color:yellow">Rarity</span>: [giggles] "Ne'er-do-wells" or not, I know I can always count on all of you  And nothing could be more perfect than that  Plaid Stripes: [sipping] [credits]			<br>
