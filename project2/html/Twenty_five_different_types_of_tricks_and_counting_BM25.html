Twilight Sparkle: True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math  But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic? Spike: Like you, Twilight, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> you know a ton <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> magic  Twilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, stop  I'm sure there are lots <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me  Spike: Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Equestria with your kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ability, Twilight  Snails: Gangway! Comin' through! Spike: Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on? Snails: Wha, haven't you heard? Spike: Whoa! Snails: There's a new unicorn in town! Snips: Yeah!

Applejack: Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f like a school filly with fancy new ribbons  Rarity: Just because one has the ability to perform lots <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> magic does not make one better than the rest <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> us  Rainbow Dash: Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> us  [laughter] Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic  Boo! Trixie: Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience  Who is so ignorant  as to challenge the magical ability <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie?  Do they not know that they're in the presence <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the most magical  unicorn in all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Equestria? Rarity: [raspberry] Just who does she think she is? Spike: Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is— Twilight Sparkle: Spike! Shhh! Spike: What? What's wrong? Twilight Sparkle: You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f  [fanfare] Rainbow Dash: So, "Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie"  What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway? Trixie: Heh, why, only the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major! [fanfare, fireworks] Audience: Ahh! Snips: What? Snails: No way! Trixie: When all hope was lost, the ponies <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington  had no one to turn to, but the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie stepped in,  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> sent it back  to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest! Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: Saw, sweet! Snips: That settles it  Snails: Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville  Snips: No, in all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Equestria! Spike: How do you know? You didn't see it! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> besides, Twi— [zip!] Mmph! M-mmph! Trixie: [laughter] It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers  Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville  [crickets] Trixie: Don't believe the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie?  [chuckles] Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians  Anything you  can do, I can do better  Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined  to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!? [fireworks <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> fanfare] Spike: [zip] Please! She's unbearable! Ya gotta show her! Ya just gotta! [cries] Twilight Sparkle: There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike  Especially since— Trixie: Hmm, how about you? Twilight Sparkle: [gulps] [music] Trixie: Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie can't? Twilight Sparkle: I— I— Trixie: Well, little hayseed? Applejack: That's it! I can't st<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> for no more <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> this! Spike: You show her, AJ! Applejack: Can your magical powers do this?

Audience: [laughter <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> cheers] Trixie: Once again, the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie prevails  Rainbow Dash: There's no need to go struttin' around <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> showin' <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f like that  Trixie: Oh? Rainbow Dash: That's my job! [electric guitar music] Rainbow Dash: They don't call me "Rainbow" <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> "Dash" for nothin'! Audience: [cheers] Trixie: When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser  [rapid music] Rainbow Dash: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a! [gulp] I think I'm [gulp] gonna be sick  Trixie: Seems like anypony with a dash <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie  [thunder] Rainbow Dash: Ow! [laughter] Spike: What we need is another unicorn to challenge her  Someone with some magic <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> her own  Rainbow Dash: Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss  Applejack: A real unicorn to unicorn tussle  Twilight Sparkle: Uh    Rarity: Enough  Enough, all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you  I take your hint,  but Rarity is above such nonsense  Rainbow Dash <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Applejack may behave  like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> grace  Trixie: Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> place in that rat's nest you call a mane? Rarity: Oh, it  Is  On! You may think you're tough with  all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your  brutish ways  A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle  A unicorn  needs to have style  Audience: Ooh! Rarity: A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> beauty  Spike: Rarity won't let Trixie get the best <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's— Audience: [gasps] Rarity: Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair! Twilight Sparkle: Nothing  Rainbow Dash: It's fine  Applejack: It's gorgeous  Spike: It's green  What? Rarity: Ugh, no  Green hair! Not green hair! [cries] Such an awful, awful color! [cries] Golden Harvest: Well, I never! Spike: Well Twilight, guess it's up to you  Come on, show her what you're made <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Twilight Sparkle: What do you mean? I'm nothing special  Spike: Yes, you are! You're better than her! Twilight Sparkle: I'm not better than anyone  Trixie: Hah! You think you're better than the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on,  show Trixie what you've got  Show us all  Twilight Sparkle: Who, me? I'm just your run-<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>-the-mill  citizen <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Ponyville  No powerful magic here  I, uh    I think I hear  my laundry calling  Sorry, gotta go  Spike: Twilight? Trixie: Ha! Once again, the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie  has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Equestria   Huh, was there ever any doubt? Snips: Here's your smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it  Snails: Mmm, hay  Trixie: [sips] Yes? Snips: Ooo, tell us another story, Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie  Snails: Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major  Trixie: Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination  Begone with you until morning  Snails: Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course, Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie  Snips: Anything you say  We are at your beck <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> call  Trixie: Ah  Spike: What are you two doin'? Snips: Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a— Spike: The what? Snips: The Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie  Spike: Sheesh  Snips: Just bringin' her a smoothie  Spike: How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f  Unlike Twilight, who— Snips: The Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major  Can your Twilight claim that? Spike: Oh really? Were you guys actually there? Snips: Well, eh, uh    no, but— Spike: But nothin'  The pro<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> is in the pudding  Snails: [laughs] I like pudding  Spike: Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the  street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says,  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> neither should you! Snips: Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Snails: Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas? Snips: Yeah, uh    oh, come on! Spike: Twilight, would you put down that book <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> just listen to me? Twilight Sparkle: Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's  bragging, Spike? If I go out there <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> show <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f my magic, I run the  risk <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> losing them as friends  Spike: It's not the same thing, Twilight  You'll be using your magic to st<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> up for your friends! Twilight Sparkle: No, Spike, it's exactly the same  Spike: Come on, Twilight, any one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> these <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie  Twilight Sparkle: I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie  [door slam, door open] Spike: But you're the best! Twilight Sparkle: Uh  Please, Spike, I said no! Spike: [sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine  [door slam, door open] [spooky music <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> sounds] Snips: Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> in front <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my face? Snails: Hold on  [grunts] Snips: Oh, heh  That's better  [growl] Snails: Yaaaah! Snips: Yaaaah! Ursa: [roar] Snips: [screaming] Spike: Hey, guys, where ya goin'? Snails: [breathing hard] Snips: Can't talk now  Snails: Got a major problem! Snips: Yeah, ursa major, to be exact  [roar] Spike: Huh? Ursa: [roar] Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: Trixie! Spike: Twilight! [banging on door] Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: Trixie! [mingled speech] Trixie: Trixie thought she said the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed! Snips: [nervous laughter] We— We have a— a tiny problem  Snails: Actually, it's a big one  Trixie: What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie? [roar] Ursa: [roar] Trixie: [screams] Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: [screams] Ursa: [roar] Spike: Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick! Twilight Sparkle: I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie! Spike: No, you don't underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>, it's— [roar] Twilight Sparkle: Uh, is that what I think it is? Spike: Majorly  Snips: Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa  Snails: Yeah, vanquish so we can watch  Snips: It took a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> trouble to get that thing here  Trixie: Wait, you brought this here? [gasp] Are you out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> your little pony minds? Snips: But, you're the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie  Snails: Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major  Ursa: [roar] Trixie: Uh, okay  [gulp] St<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> back  [snake charmer music] Trixie: Heh  Piece <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> cake  [growls, snap] Snips: Aw, come on, Trixie  Snails: Stop go<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>in' around <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> vanquish it, eh? Trixie: [gasp, gulp] Snails: Well, that was a dud  Snips: Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> smoke <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> stuff like earlier? You know  [crackle] Trixie: Uh-oh  Ursa: [roar] Snips, Snails, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Trixie: [screams] Ursa: [roar] [ponies gasp] Ursa: [roar] [crash] [ponies crying in fear] Twilight Sparkle: What's going on? Snips: We brought an ursa to town  Twilight Sparkle: You what!?! Snails: Don't worry, the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie will vanquish it  Trixie: I can't  Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: What!? Trixie: Oh, I can't, I never have  No one can vanquish an ursa major  I just made the whole story up to make me look better  Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: Made it up!? Ursa: [growl] [roar] [ponies gasp] Twilight Sparkle: [gulp] Ursa: [growl] Twilight Sparkle: [groans] [wind] [music from broken cattails] Ursa: [growl] [grunt] [guttural sigh] Spike: Nice use <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> number sixteen  [metallic sounds] [water flowing] [milking sounds <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> moos] Unidentified cow: Golly, dont'cha know? Spike: That's new  [metallic clank] Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Ursa: [sucking] [cheering] Rainbow Dash: Unbelievable! Spike: That was amazing! Applejack: Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much! Twilight Sparkle: I'm sorry  Please, please don't hate me  Rainbow Dash, Applejack, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Rarity: Hate you? Rarity: Why, whatever do you mean, darling? Twilight Sparkle: Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f with her magic <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I just thought-- Rainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa  Magic's got nothing to do with it  Trixie's just a loudmouth  Rarity: Most unpleasant  Applejack: All hat <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> no cattle  Twilight Sparkle: So, you don't mind my magic <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>? Applejack: Your magic is a part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> who you are,  sugarcube, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> we like who you are  We're proud to have such a powerful,  talented unicorn as our friend  Rainbow Dash: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder  Twilight Sparkle: You are? Rainbow Dash: Uh-huh  Applejack: Mm-hmm  Rarity: Mm-hmm  Spike: Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major? Twilight Sparkle: That's what I was doing when you came  looking for me  I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was  compelled to do a little reading up on them  Spike: So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself? Twilight Sparkle: That wasn't an ursa major  It was a baby, an ursa minor  Trixie: That was just a baby? Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> it wasn't rampaging  It was just cranky because someone woke it up  Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: Awww    Spike: Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like? Twilight Sparkle: You don't wanna know  Trixie: Huh  You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but  you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  Powerful Trixie! [retreating ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>beats] Rainbow Dash: Why, that little    Twilight Sparkle: Just let her go  Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson  Now, about you two  Snips: Ah [nervous laughter]  Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor  Snails: We just wanted to see some awesome magic  Snips: Yeah! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome! Snails: We deserve whatever punishment you give us  Twilight Sparkle: For starters, you can clean up this mess  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span>    What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>? Spike: Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>! Yes! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I think I deserve it, too  Snips <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Snails: Heah? Twilight Sparkle: I think you're right  Snips, Snails, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Spike: Sweet! Twilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia, I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I  was so afraid <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> being thought <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> as a show-<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f that I was hiding a part  <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> who I am  My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  your talents, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> there are times when it's appropriate to show them  <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f    Especially when you're st<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>ing up for your friends  Spike: So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Ponyville? Twilight Sparkle: Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about  So, uh, how did it go with Rarity? Spike: Eh, she didn't go for the mustache  Twilight Sparkle: You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are  Maybe you should just try being yourself  Spike: Or    Maybe the mustache wasn't enough  Maybe if I had a mustache <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> a beard? Twilight Sparkle: Uh, not this again! Spike: Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard  Or maybe a goatee  Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin! [music] [credits]			<br>

[thud] Ms  Harshwhinny: Pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essionalism, Ms  Dash  I must  insist  If you want to keep your job as coach <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> these ponies, you must  maintain a pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essional attitude <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> keep your emotions in check! Am I  making myself absolutely, one hundred percent crystal clear? Rainbow Dash: Yes, Ms  Harshwhinny  Y'know, "pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essionalism" is my middle name  Rainbow Pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essionalism Dash  Ms  Harshwhinny: Hmph!

Scootaloo: Listen  Somepony in our class is gonna carry  that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you  in? 'Cause I'm in! Apple Bloom: Me too! [beat] Sweetie Belle: Me three! Scootaloo: Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right? Apple Bloom <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle: Right! Scootaloo: So    what's special about Ponyville? It's     It's    I got it! It's a place where <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> kinds <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies live  together as friends! Apple Bloom: Earth ponies like me! Sweetie Belle: Unicorns like me! Scootaloo: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act  Sweetie Belle: We're gonna need a plan  Apple Bloom: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> hard work! Scootaloo: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> a whole bunch <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses! [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle] We're the toughest little ponies in town Got the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around We are a trio, work as a team We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene We get going when the going gets tough We know our very best is just never enough We're kinda short, but so what? We don't get defeated We could take a little break, but we don't need it We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses When we put our minds together, we can achieve We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> you should believe We've got determination to represent the nation For the win We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> we're playing to win as we gallop to glory We can conquer any challenge we're in We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses Hearts strong as horses  Crusaders: Whoa! [thud] Crusaders: O<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>! [clapping] Diamond Tiara: If that's the best you've got, we're going to win for sure  Silver Spoon: We already have the most divine routine planned  Diamond Tiara: It's absolutely sure to crush everyone else – <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I mean crush  Scootaloo: But we're winners! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> we have [starts singing] hearts-- Silver Spoon: Sure  But you know what you don't have? Diamond Tiara <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Silver Spoon: Your cutie marks! Blank flanks, blank flanks, blank flanks! Apple Bloom: What does that have to do with flag carryin'? Silver Spoon: Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable  Diamond Tiara: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> we, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course, already have our cutie marks  So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle  Scootaloo: Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games  Silver Spoon: May the best ponies win! Scootaloo: Game on! Rainbow Dash: Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> make it good! Scootaloo: Don't worry, we will! Sweetie Belle: Now, this is just a little something we threw together  It's not perfect yet, not even close  Diamond Tiara: Let's watch the Cutie Mark "Go<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>-saders" do their saddle routine  Silver Spoon: They're gonna be a hot mess! Diamond Tiara <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Silver Spoon: [giggling] Scootaloo: Since the dawn <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> recorded time, in one town <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> amazing amazingness, three <span style="background-color:yellow">types</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies coexist! Apple Bloom: We are Earth ponies! Sweetie Belle: We are unicorns! Scootaloo: We are Pegasi! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> the town where friendship reigns is our home  Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the place we love best    Crusaders: Ponyville forever! Yay! Scootaloo: It's kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a work in progress  So? What did you think? Rainbow Dash: That was ama-- [in her head] Wait  Hold on now  Gotta stay calm, cool <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> collected  [out loud] To give a calm, clear analysis-- Wait  You whipped that act together just yesterday?! That is-- [in her head] Pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check!  [out loud] Overall, it was    kinda, sorta    [quickly] Overall, it was  okay  Keep working hard  Who knows? You might have a shot  Gotta go! Apple Bloom: Do y'all think she liked it? Sweetie Belle: I'm not really sure  Scootaloo: You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies! Diamond Tiara: Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this  They could win! Silver Spoon: But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks! Diamond Tiara: Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin  Or maybe    get under their wings  Diamond Tiara: Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive! Sweetie Belle: Wait    What? Apple Bloom: Um    Thanks? Silver Spoon: Oh, but <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course  As a matter <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> fact, we think you're very brave  Scootaloo: Brave? Why? Diamond Tiara: Isn't it obvious? It is to us  In fact,  it's obvious to everypony  You're showing all three <span style="background-color:yellow">types</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Ponyville  ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony    Diamond Tiara <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Silver Spoon:    who can't even fly! Apple Bloom: What in tarnation does that have to do with anything? Silver Spoon: I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything  Doesn't it? Diamond Tiara: I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago  Scootaloo: So what if my wings can't get me <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f the ground? Diamond Tiara: Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f the ground either  Silver Spoon: Ms  Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Equestria  Sweetie Belle: Ms  Harshwhinny never said anything about that! Silver Spoon: I would've thought that was obvious  Diamond Tiara: Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will never—how shall I say—take <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f! Sweetie Belle: Don't listen to them, Scootaloo  Scootaloo? You okay? Scootaloo: This routine isn't working how it is  We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing  Sweetie Belle: What? Apple Bloom: Why? Scootaloo: If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly! Sweetie Belle: Is that even possible? Apple Bloom: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> by tomorrow? Scootaloo: Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard  See? O<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>! Maybe    three times as hard  Apple Bloom: Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem  Scootaloo: Well, I know this for sure – flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice! Sweetie Belle: Is this a good idea? Scootaloo: Whoaaaaa! [thud] Scootaloo: I'll just work four times as hard! Apple Bloom: Probably not  Scootaloo: [sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again! Apple Bloom: [yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired! Scootaloo: Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying  entrance  So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right,  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> then there's the hoop  Then I come in-- [thud] Scootaloo: Not quite what I had in mind  We'll just    try that part again  [straining noises] Apple Bloom: [hushed] I liked the routine the way it was! Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Me too! But all she cares about now is flying! Scootaloo: Don't worry, I'll be flying high tomorrow on  our final run-through for Rainbow Dash  I'm gonna get this, you'll see   [straining noises] [thud] Rainbow Dash: Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your  final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow  I know you're  gonna absolutely, positively-- have a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> fun, heheh  Okay, go!  [blows whistle] Scootaloo: [panting] Ponyville! Home <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the, um    Apple Bloom <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Friendship! Scootaloo: Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four-- no, three kinds <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies  Apple Bloom: [yawns] Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Left, left! Apple Bloom: [hushed] I'm sorry! I'm just tired! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> then I dip, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> then we turn, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>-- Sorry! Apple Bloom <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle: [straining noises] [boing] [thud] Scootaloo: Ta-da! O<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>! [panting] So? What'cha think? Rainbow Dash: That's    y'know    good <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> all, heheh     I just thought    maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the  first version <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better?  Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right?  Seriously  Now I need to    go coach these other ponies! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> don't  forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire  See  you in the morning! Scootaloo: What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I still can't fly! Unless    Sweetie Belle: I'm just too tired! I can't keep going! Apple Bloom: Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now! Sweetie Belle: She's right  It's like you don't even need us anymore! Scootaloo: <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop? Apple Bloom: Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it  I'm goin' home to get some sleep  Scootaloo: So? Are you gonna leave me too? Sweetie Belle: We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire  I'd better get some rest  See you in the morning, Scootaloo  Scootaloo: Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> times as hard! [straining noises] Thirty times as hard   ! O<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>! Just    a little    harder! [thud] Scootaloo: [straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly  I just    can't  Train conductor: Crystal Empire! All aboard! Sweetie Belle: Scootaloo? Where is she? Apple Bloom: She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave! Scootaloo: Here I am    Apple Bloom: We were scared you were gonna miss the train! Scootaloo: I    I'm not going  Apple Bloom <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle: What?! Scootaloo: I'm the weak link  If I go, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two  Sweetie Belle: I can't believe you're quitting on us! Scootaloo: But you're better <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f without me! Sweetie Belle: But that's not true, Scootaloo! Apple Bloom: You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it  If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> we don't need her! Scootaloo: Fine! Apple Bloom: Fine! Sweetie Belle: Fine    Train conductor: All aboard! [train puffing] [train whistle blowing] Rainbow Dash: How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I  just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom,  bom, bom    <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the  hoop! Apple Bloom: Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo  Sweetie Belle: She's staying home  Rainbow Dash: She's what?! Apple Bloom: She got it in her head that the only way to  represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do  it, she told us that she was quittin'  Rainbow Dash: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> then you tried to stop her from doing that, right? Sweetie Belle: Well, actually, we kinda told her    Apple Bloom:    uh, that we didn't want a quitter  Rainbow Dash: Hang on  Are you nuts?! You're a team, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> a team never leaves a friend behind! [ding] [brakes squealing] Rainbow Dash: Come on! Diamond Tiara: Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle! Diamond Tiara <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Silver Spoon: [laughing, under] Sweetie Belle: I do not like them one bit  Rainbow Dash: Put on some speed, girls! [ripping noises] [clang] Rainbow Dash: Throwing away your scooter?! Scootaloo: Rainbow Dash? Rainbow Dash: Yup, but not just me  Scootaloo: I don't wanna see them  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train  Apple Bloom: We're not goin'  Sweetie Belle: Not without you, Scootaloo  Rainbow Dash: What's gotten into you, Scootaloo? Scootaloo: I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly  Rainbow Dash: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> who said you had to? Scootaloo: But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games! Rainbow Dash: But that was me! You're you! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> it just  doesn't matter if you can fly or not  Your routine was amazing 'cause it  represented exactly what makes Ponyville special  You do still know what that is, right? Sweetie Belle: Friendship  Apple Bloom: Three kinds <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies livin' together as friends  Just like us  Earth ponies    Sweetie Belle:    unicorns    Scootaloo:    <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pegasi  But Rainbow Dash    what if    what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly? Rainbow Dash: Listen, Scootaloo  Maybe you'll fly  someday, or maybe you won't  You're all kinds <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> awesome anyway  Who's  the toughest little pony in town? [Sweetie Belle] Got the moves, got the mojo    [Apple Bloom] No harder working pony around  [Scootaloo] We are a trio, work as a team [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle] We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene Scootaloo: So let's get to the Crystal Empire <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> let's do the routine as it was! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> let's win this thing! [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sweetie Belle] We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> we're playing to win as we gallop to glory We can conquer any challenge we're in We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses Hearts strong as horses [crowd cheering] Crusaders: Ponyville forever! Yay! [microphone feedback] Ms  Harshwhinny: [through microphone] In the Equestria Games, the Ponyville flag will be carried by    'Cutie Mark Crusaders'! [crowd cheering] Diamond Tiara <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Silver Spoon: [groaning] Rainbow Dash: Ahem  Look  What you three did was    acceptable  Ms  Harshwhinny: Acceptable? Acceptable?! Why, it was totally stupendously the single most amazing thing I've ever seen! [laughs] Rainbow Dash: Contain your excitement, Ms  Harshwhinny  Remember – pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essionalism  Ms  Harshwhinny: Ahem  Y-Yes, well, I- [laughs nervously] Rainbow Dash <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Crusaders: [laughing] Scootaloo: You know what this means, right?

Fluttershy: Las Pegasus?! Applejack: But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot! It's just one big party! Fluttershy: All those lights <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> sounds, not to mention the crowds    Oh, just the thought <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it is overwhelming! Twilight Sparkle: I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem like  either <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> your cups <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> tea, but I have total faith you wouldn't have  been called unless you were the perfect ponies for the job  Applejack: Probably not as bad as we think  It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time    right? [pop] Fluttershy: Uh, Applejack? It isn't as bad as we thought  [crowds cheering] Applejack: You're right  It's worse! [theme song] Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Fluttershy: [gasp] [general chatter] Fluttershy: Do you think the map could be on the fritz  again? I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even  Rainbow Dash  Applejack: If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I  All  we have to do is solve our friendship problem <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> get back home   'Course, we have to find it first  Barker: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> make sure to experience our signature show, Ponet Fantastique!  Trust me when I say you've never seen anything like it! Unparalleled  acrobatics! Unique animal antics! Your only regret will be that you  didn't see it sooner! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> like everything at this amazing, incredible,  I-can't-believe-it-even-exists hotel, Ponet Fantastique is brought to you by the chairpony <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> kindness – Gladmane himself! [crowd gasping] Fluttershy: Wow  This Gladmane sure seems impressive  Gladmane: Well, uh, it is a little embarrassing, but the crowds seem to like it  Uh-huh-huh  Applejack: Mr  Gladmane? Gladmane: Just Gladmane'll do  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> it's a pleasure to  meet actual cohorts <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Princess <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Friendship! Thank you for coming   Thank you very much  Fluttershy: You know who we are? Gladmane: I'm what you might call a friendship  connoisseur, so naturally I'm familiar with the friends <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the great  Twilight Sparkle! Applejack, Fluttershy, it's an honor to have you here   Uh-huh-huh  Applejack: I have to admit you're not the type <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus  Gladmane: [laughs] Well, my guests may be looking for  lights, music, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> parties, but working hard <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> making friends is how I  turned this hotel into what it is today, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> how I plan to make it even  bigger  Uh-huh-huh! Uh, excuse me for a second  [inhales] [through  loudspeaker] Wise ponies may say the folks that come here are  customers, but I can't help but thinkin' <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> each <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> every one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you as  friends  That's why there's a three-for-one special on apple fritters  in the cafe for the next hour! Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh! [crowd chattering] Gladmane: Would you two like to take a tour <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the place? I'm just about to do my rounds <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> check on my friends who work here  Fluttershy: [hushed] We do have a friendship problem to find  Applejack: Lead the way, Mr  Gladmane! Gladmane: Just Gladmane now, you hear? Trapeze Star: [gasps] Gladmane, you're just in time to see my newest move! Gladmane: New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what  Trapeze Star: Oh, don't make me blush! Now watch this! Gladmane: Stellar! Uh-huh-huh! Director: Oh! Oh! Monsieur Gladmane himself is here! Let's run through the whole routine! Gladmane: Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me  I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Fluttershy  Applejack: Howdy! Fluttershy: Hi  Director: If zis pony calls you friend, you're welcome backstage anytime! I owe him my entire career  Gladmane: Aw, shucks  Well, let's leave the artists to their work  Applejack: [hushed] Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here  Fluttershy: [gasps] I've never seen a pink prairie dog before! [prairie dog squeaking] Gladmane: I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience  Uh-huh-huh  "Roar Horn": Und we love him for it! "Sprigfield": With Gladmane's help, we've been able to take care <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> all these little guys! Fluttershy: Now this place is overwhelming in a good way! Gladmane: Aw, glad you like it  Applejack: [clears throat] Fluttershy? Fluttershy: Hmm? Oh, um, coming! Fluttershy: There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all  Applejack: I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in  Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  needles  But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine  Flim: Ladies <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> gentleponies, despite what my  competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be  entertained, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than  the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Ponet Fantastique! Flam: Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't  for the existence, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> far superiorly entertaining presence, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the  show-stopping exotic animal act that Ponet Fantastique includes! Fluttershy: Those voices sound familiar  Applejack: They sure do  Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam  Flim: Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fering them to you at a substantial discount! Flam: But I've always thought you get what you pay for, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price! Flim: Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride! Flam: [gasps] Charlatan? How dare you! Flim: Hah! How dare I?! Flam: [simultaneous] Yes, how dare you! I was the one that    Flim: [simultaneous] I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> mine! Flam: [simultaneous, background] I'm two minutes older than you – don't you forget that, brother <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> mine! Flim: [simultaneous, background] I'm sick <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> tired <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> this    Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam: [further unintelligible arguing] Fluttershy: They certainly don't seem to be getting along  [gasps] You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them? Applejack: Absolutely not! Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam: [arguing] Fluttershy: I know you <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> the rest <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Apple family  have had your issues with Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam in the past, but they're  definitely having trouble, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> solving a friendship problem is  important, no matter who's having it  Applejack: Well, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course that's true    for anypony but them! Gladmane: I'm sorry you had to see that  I don't know  why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here  I  thought giving them these jobs might help, but I    I guess it just made  matters worse  Applejack: Trust me  I know those ponies, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> you're  better <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f with them apart  The two <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> them together will cheat the  hooves right out from under you! Gladmane: Yeah, I suppose you're right  Flim's such a  showpony, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam has such a head for business  Why, if they ever did  work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking  <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> which, I'd better get back to work  Y'all enjoy your stay now, you  hear? Fluttershy: I'm pretty sure we should help Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam    Applejack: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it! Fluttershy: [sighs] Flim: I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother  Flam: Brother? I don't believe I have one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> those  Flim: No! I already know what he thinks <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> me! All show  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble  becoming a big success on his own! Flam: "Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course!" Just ask him  He'll tell you all about it  Fluttershy: I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> talked to each other  Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam: I'm never speaking to that pony again! Fluttershy: [sighs] [general casino chatter <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> noises] Director: [muffled] No! [normal] You are ruining my show! Trapeze Star: It isn't just your show, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I'm improving it  Director: You don't pull a rabbit out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a hat on the trapeze! Trapeze Star: That's the point – to give the audience something they've never seen before! Acrobatic magic! [twirling] Bernard Rabbit: Ta-da! Trapeze Star: It's called "blending genres", <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> it's awesome! Applejack: Shouldn't somepony do somethin'? "Back Stage": Hah  They've been doing this since they  started working here  Too bad, really  If they ever stopped shouting at  each other, we could take the show on tour  They'd be way more successful than staying at Gladmane's  Applejack: Heh-heh  Now that sounds like a real friendship problem! "Roar Horn": Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! "Sprigfield": Stop! What are you doing?! It's supposed to be a pink prairie dog pyramid! It's alliterative! "Roar Horn": Wha— You said a tower! Why do you keep changing everything? [prairie dogs squeaking] "Sprigfield": I'm not changing anything! You said pyramid! "Roar Horn": [shrieks] You are driving me crazy! Applejack: I thought you two got along  "Sprigfield": We used to, but we just can't seem to  agree on anything anymore  We used to perform all over Equestria, but if  we can't agree on a new act, we might as well stay at Gladmane's  forever  [stomping] Applejack: Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'! Fluttershy: If you count Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place! Applejack: Well, I don't count Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem  Fluttershy: It certainly isn't for Gladmane  Sounds like he's better <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f with them fighting  Applejack: Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed  to be good for Gladmane too  Both the trapeze show <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> the animal act  would be better <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that  they can't  Fluttershy: Do you think he knows? Applejack: I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out  Trapeze Star: <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> course Gladmane wants everypony to get  along  He's the nicest, most genuine pony I've ever met  Did the  director put you up to this? Bernard Rabbit: [unintelligible whispering] Director: I tell you, if Gladmane is your friend, you are welcome backstage  But if you are speaking <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> him poorly, you leave! "Roar Horn": Gladmane is the kindest, most gentle    "Sprigfield":    most compassionate pony I've ever known! "Roar Horn" <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> "Sprigfield": My problem    is with him! [prairie dogs squeaking] Applejack: I just can't figure it! The only pony who  benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's  the best friend any <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> these ponies have! Fluttershy: Well, Bernard – that adorable bunny from the  acrobat's act – claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director  that the star wants control <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the show, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> every afternoon tells the  star that the director wants to get rid <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> her! But neither is true! Applejack: [snorts] Fluttershy: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> the Flying Prairinos – the pink prairie  dog family – say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer  think the other is doing it! Applejack: So all his talk about friendship is just a load <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose! Fluttershy: But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing? Applejack: There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth! Fluttershy: Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>ter  Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam: [unintelligible arguing] Fluttershy: Or maybe a pair <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies? Applejack: [sighs] Fine  Guess bringin' Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam back together might be why we're here  Maybe  Flim: Sorry if I don't take the word <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> somepony <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f the street, even if that street is in Ponyville  Fluttershy: But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems  How can you be sure he isn't the cause <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> yours? Flam: Because the only problem I have is st<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>ing right there  Flim: Same here, buster! Applejack: Do either <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you even know what you're fightin' over? Flim: Gladmane let me know that ex-brother <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea! Flam: Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks! Applejack: Sounds to me like neither <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you said those things  Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did? Flim: Why would he lie? Fluttershy: Because he's afraid that the two <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you together could move in <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> take over his resort  Applejack: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because— Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam: You never lie! Flam: Oh, brother <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> mine, I think it's time for a little payback! Flim: The Canterlot Two-Step? Flam: Mmm, we don't have the chickens  How about the Baltimare Flair? Flim: Ah, my flair isn't what it used to be  Gladmane: [over loudspeaker] Listen here, y'all! If  you're a friend <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  everypony is a friend <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> mine! Thank you  Thank you very much  Flim: Are you thinking what I am? Flam: The High Roller Hustle! Applejack: The what now? Flam: Trust us  When we're done, there won't be a pony  in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That  is, assuming you two are willing to help  Flim: What size gown do you wear? [crowd chattering <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> cameras clicking] Gladmane: Wh-What's all the fuss, now? Flim: It's the gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> matriarch <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the wealthiest ponies in Equestria  Gladmane: Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch  Flim: Well, she's not exactly a guest  Word is she's  planning a resort <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> her own  [hushed] I think she's here to scout the  competition  Gladmane: [hushed] Oh, really? Flim: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants! Gladmane: [growling] Flim: Uh, not me, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course! I love it here  My good-for-nothing brother, on the other ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>    Gladmane: [snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is  to have you at my humble <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>-ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> resort  I'm sure Flam has done an  excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized  tour from the mane himself  Uh-huh-huh  Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: You'll have to excuse Ms  Rich  She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> uses it to make more money  Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour? Gladmane: Well, that sounds right pleasant  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> if you  can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fice so I  can get ready  [curtain rustling] Fluttershy: Are all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you sure this is a good idea? Flim: Abso-tively! Flam: Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good! Applejack: I sure hope you two know what you're doin'  Flam: Oho, don't you worry  When it comes to throwing ponies <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f their game    Flim: No two ponies do it better than us! Applejack: Can't argue with that  [door opens] Flam: Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour  So what did you want to see me about? Gladmane: Actually, there's something I want you to see – the Gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Plan  Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> every one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> 'em mine  Flam: [whistles] Gladmane: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this  [click] Gladmane: [over loudspeaker] Hey there, friends  Uh-huh-huh  If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Ponet Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now  Two for the price <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> one! Thank you  Thank you very much  [click] Gladmane: Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fer to come work for her  Flam: Well uh, now that you mention it    Gladmane: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> as your friend, I'd never tell you what to  do  But nopony's gonna st<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> in the way <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my plans, no matter how rich  she is! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side   Think you might consider staying here? Flam: Um    Gladmane: Well all right then  Applejack: They're comin'! Gladmane: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> last but not least, Ms  Rich, the jewel in my crown  Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> this caliber going for long  Gladmane: Oh? <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> why's that? Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: Because you've got the best talents in the industry  What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor? Gladmane: [laughs] Well, you see I have a trick for  that, I must confess  Uh-huh-huh  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> it all has to do [also over  loudspeaker] with how I h<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>le my employees  Flam: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> how is that? Gladmane: [also over loudspeaker] Well, like friends, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I treat every one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my employees with the kindness they deserve  Flam: [stammering] That's it? That's your secret, heh-heh? There's    [clears throat]    nothing else? Gladmane: Nope, just friendship  But you know all about friendship, don't you    Fluttershy?! Flim: You knew the whole time? Gladmane: Never try to con a con-pony  Uh-huh-huh  [laughs] Yeah! [bits jingling] [door opens] Gladmane: I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now  Fluttershy: Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just    mean! Gladmane: Now, maybe it is  But it's a meanness that  works  Unlike your pathetic little ploy  I practically invented the  "High Roller Hustle"  But I suppose I should be impressed  You're the  only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success  Takes a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  work keepin' everypony fightin'  But as long as I keep 'em convinced  that I'm their only friend, all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Las Pegasus will be mine  Oh, you can't trick a confession out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead  Applejack: Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession! Gladmane: Oh, no  No, no, w-w-wait, wait! Fluttershy: [over loudspeaker] Did that sound okay? Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam: Never better! Applejack: [over loudspeaker] Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam told us  you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> that once you did,  you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  the plan! Gladmane: Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything! Director: I think you've done enough <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> that! Darling? Trapeze Star: Hmph! "Roar Horn": Oh, I cannot believe we let him almost ruin our friendship! "Sprigfield": <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> our act  Good luck finding another one! Gladmane: Wait! No! Y'all come back! Come on, I-I'm  gonna be ruined! This is Gladmane's, y'all! Come on, you can't do this  to    [wailing trails <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f] Applejack: Gladmane has left the buildin'! [crunching, crash] Fluttershy: I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all  [cutie marks ringing] Fluttershy: If it weren't for your history with Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to  help, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing  Applejack: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> if it weren't for you wantin' to  show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able  to trick the <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>ter  [to Flim <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Flam] Must've felt pretty nice to  finally put all your connivin' <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> cheatin' skills to good use  Flam: In fact, we might think <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity  Flim: Emphasis on "once"  Fluttershy: [suspiciously] What do you mean? Flam: [over loudspeaker] While this establishment  undergoes a slight change in management, my brother <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I want to assure  you that it remains the pinnacle <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is  why we invite each <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> every one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you to experience the wonder <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the  Ponet Fantastique Theater – at half the normal cost <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> admission! Flim: [over loudspeaker] <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> while you're  appreciating this historic venue totally devoid <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> any performers <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> any  kind, we invite you to use the wonder <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> your own imaginations to fill  the space at no additional charge!

[thud!] Spike: Twilight, mail's here! [doors opening] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] [squeak] Twilight Sparkle: Are you all right? Derpy: We just had a really heavy delivery today  Spike: Is it a deluxe set <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> special edition Ogres & Oubliettes figurines that I'm totally surprised by <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> have been hinting that I need forever? Derpy: Well, it's for Twilight  Spike: Awww    Twilight Sparkle: Thank you  Derpy: You're welcome! Twilight Sparkle: Huh  It's from Princess Celestia  Spike: [belches] So is this  Really? She couldn't have put it into the box? Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have  been conducting a thorough cleaning <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the castle, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I came across a  few items <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> yours in your old room  I thought you might want them  back " I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this?  It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a  filly! Spike: [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that? Twilight Sparkle: My G1 Star Swirl figure! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> some <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my favorite school scrolls! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true! Spike: Is my Smash Fortune comic in there? I've been looking for that for years  Whoa, whoa! [thud] Spike: [muffled] Or this  Twilight Sparkle: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Spike: What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book  Twilight Sparkle: Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's    overdue! [theme song] Twilight Sparkle: You don't underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record! Spike: [clears throat] Had a perfect record  Twilight Sparkle: [groans] I've never turned in a book even a minute late! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> this one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville! [stamping] Dusty Pages: Make sure you bring this one back on time  We've got a long waiting list <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ponies who can't wait to read it  Twilight Sparkle: I promise I won't let you down! Dusty Pages: Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course, you won't, dear  If there's  anypony I can trust to take care <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle   After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title  Twilight Sparkle: Oooh! I hope I do forever! Twilight Sparkle: Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Predictions <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Prophecies  What's that for? Spike: Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but    Twilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> thing  Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> then Celestia sent me to Ponyville,  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books  were damaged or lost on her watch, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I failed her! I failed myself! Spike: I take it we're going to Canterlot? [zip!] Spike: [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess  Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] [leaves rustling] Spike: Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book? Twilight Sparkle: Yes  But what if somepony sees me in  there? I'm the Princess <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Friendship  Everywhere I go, ponies recognize  me  I'll stick out like a sore ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Spike: [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses! Twilight Sparkle: A late book is a big deal, Spike  What  if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering  the building again?! Spike: Don't you already have most <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> those books in your collection at home? Twilight Sparkle: Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell! Spike: You sniff books? Twilight Sparkle: You don't? I used to live in a library  If I'm not a good example <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> princess am I? Spike: One that makes mistakes like everypony else  Trust me  Once you return that book, you'll feel way better  Twilight Sparkle: Thanks, Spike  Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously] Spike: [groans] [teleportation zaps] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return  Librarian Pony: Princess Twilight! So good to see you! Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Librarian Pony: Need some recommendations from the new release section? Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Is that the new edition <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Mooncurve's Seven Theories on Bending Time? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks! [ponies gasp] Twilight Sparkle: But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a    [clears throat] sensitive matter  Librarian Pony: Dusty who? Twilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever  Librarian Pony: I'm sorry, princess  I don't know her  Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower? Twilight Sparkle: [nervous giggle] Spike: [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time! Twilight Sparkle: [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs]  Fine  Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out  this long will probably cost a thous<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> bits! Spike: She— I mean, we have an overdue book  Librarian Pony: [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all  In fact, it happens all the time  Spike: See? Librarian Pony: I'll just find it in the card catalog   Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow  Yeesh  I  haven't seen a book this late in    well, ever  [clears throat] You need  to go <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span>fice for  Ponies Who Should Know Better  Twilight Sparkle: Don't pull any punches with those names, do you? Spike: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> that <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fice would be   ? Librarian Pony: In the basement  [whispering] Because <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the shame  [thud] Spike: Whoa  [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here  Twilight Sparkle: Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds! Spike: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> faithful dragon companions  Uh    hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door! Twilight Sparkle: "Ab<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>on hope, all ye who enter"? Spike: [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row " Guess we'll have to try back later! Twilight Sparkle: No! I can't wait another minute to  return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up  another    seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch! Spike: Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips] [beat] Spike: Oh  You mean to find First Folio  Can we at least get takeout?! Twilight Sparkle: Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies  Spike: Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already! Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> my late fines are already up another <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>-six more bits! Spike: [mock-sobbing] Pretzel: Waiter, we're ready to order  Spike: Oh, uh, I'm not actually— Pretzel: Three samosas, two curry specials    Do you think that's enough for the two <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> us? Spike: Hm  Well, I would probably order some naan as well  For the table? Pretzel: Sounds great  Moon Dancer: Twilight? Is that you? Twilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting  No real reason  Heh  Moon Dancer: Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch  Do you want to join us? Twilight Sparkle: First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you  First Folio: Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower? Twilight Sparkle: Yeah    I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that  Moon Dancer: Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago  Didn't you know? Twilight Sparkle: Mm-mm  First Folio: Oh, I heard she was forced to leave  It's so sad  She loved the library  Twilight Sparkle: Wait  Forced to leave? First Folio: Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah  She had a perfect librarian record  Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all  Moon Dancer: Are you okay, Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: [nervously] Uh-huh  Would, uh, you excuse me? [whoosh] [spinning] Spike: That's why you only order spicy if you can take it  Twilight, what's wrong? Twilight Sparkle: Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because I didn't return this book! Spike, I think I got her fired! [brake skids] Spike: Twilight, the library is that way! Twilight Sparkle: Change <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> plans  We're going to Dusty's house  She used to invite me over for tea all the time  Spike: But what about your late fees? Twilight Sparkle: They're not as important as making things right  Spike: Wait  So you're not going to return the book? Twilight Sparkle: No  Dusty Pages is  It's my fault she  lost her job  So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back   It'll fix everything! [sighs] [knocking] [door opens] Meathead Pony: Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies! Twilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm not selling anything  Meathead Pony: No carolers either  No surveys, no petitions, no free literature    [thud] Twilight Sparkle: No problem  I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here  I'm pretty sure this was her house  Meathead Pony: Dusty Pages? Twilight Sparkle: Yes! Meathead Pony: Hold on  She moved to    Silver somethin'  Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever  When you find her, give her this  [thud] Meathead Pony: It's been stackin' up for years! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> tell her to change her address! [door slams] [montage music] [knocking] [squeaking] Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "Silver Stable Community: For the best golden years " This has to be it! Spike: I hope so  It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked  [door opens] Spike: [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is— Twilight Sparkle: Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight! S<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Trap: [snoring] Twilight Sparkle: Poor Dusty    [to receptionist] Excuse me! "Teddie Safari": Yes, how may I help you? Twilight Sparkle: Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages? "Teddie Safari": Oh, yes  Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor  Twilight Sparkle: Thank you! Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe that my carelessness sent her here, when she could be happily surrounded by millions <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> wonderful-smelling books! Spike: You realize that might just be a you thing, right? Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] There she is! Here we go  [exhales] [knocking] [long pause] [watch ticking] Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Spike: She's bound to be back soon  Maybe we should just wait here  Twilight Sparkle: No  We are fixing this now  This place isn't that big  We can find her  Twilight Sparkle: Sorry to interrupt your plein air painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages  Have you seen her? Apple Rose: Sure have! [beat] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span>   ? Apple Rose: She had to leave early to get to her fengbi de ti session  Old Stallion: Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me  Then she's on to windsurfing  Apple Rose: Ooh, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role  Again  Old Stallion: Then there's her b<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> practice later  Twilight Sparkle: Thank you! Spike: Wow  Dusty sounds like one busy pony  Twilight Sparkle: Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> losing the best job ever! But not for long! [montage music] [gate swinging] [teleportation zap] [hammer tapping] [door shuts <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> opens] [splash] [more splashes] [door opens] [door opens] [b<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> playing music] Twilight Sparkle: Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike! Spike: Wait  She looks pretty happy up there  Twilight Sparkle: Trust me, it's all an act  She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library! [music abruptly stops] Twilight Sparkle: Care to take <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>, everypony? Dusty Pages: Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here? Twilight Sparkle: I've been looking all over Equestria for you! [thud] Twilight Sparkle: I need to tell you something  Dusty Pages: Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles] Twilight Sparkle: No  I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here  I let you down, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I can't forgive myself until I set things right  Dusty Pages: I don't remember you doing anything wrong  Twilight Sparkle: You told me to take care <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I never brought it back! Dusty Pages: [gasps] It was you that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record? Twilight Sparkle: But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> get your job back! Dusty Pages: No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be  [b<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> playing music] Spike: [snapping fingers] Twilight Sparkle: Do you mind? [music pauses, continues s<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>tly] Spike: [slurping] Twilight Sparkle: I don't underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  If Dusty Pages  won't go back to Canterlot Library <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> explain everything, then she  won't be able to get her job back  Even worse, her record will remain  imperfect! Spike: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> yours will, too? Twilight Sparkle: Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more! Spike: [dryly] Really? Twilight Sparkle: Well, maybe a little bit  Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?! [abacus clicking] Spike: Uhhh    you don't wanna know  Twilight Sparkle: [groans] It would've been worth all  the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I  knew why she won't go back! Spike: Why don't you ask her? Twilight Sparkle: She didn't seem to want to talk  Spike: You surprised her, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> she probably had something  else on her schedule  That thing is packed! Come on  What have you got  to lose? Twilight Sparkle: Now that I've messed up this much?  Nothing  You're right, Spike  It's worth a try  Where do you think she  went? Crochet? Bingo? [splat] Twilight Sparkle: A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?! [splats] Spike: Hey, everypony! We come in— [splat] Spike: Eh, pieces  [splats] [teleportation zap] [splats] Twilight Sparkle: Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please? Dusty Pages: Time out! [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear  Spike: We're not actually here for the game  Twilight Sparkle: I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book  Dusty Pages: [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it? Twilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm  I know I ruined your life by  not returning my book on time, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I will do anything I can to make it  up to you  Even promise to never take a book out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a library again, if  that's what it takes  [ponies gasp] Dusty Pages: [laughs] Spike: That is not the reaction we expected  Dusty Pages: Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you! Twilight Sparkle: You're not? Dusty Pages: No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me  [tapping] Dusty Pages: All those years I spent hiding away in that  library, trying to be perfect  When your book never came in, I felt  something exhilarating! Twilight Sparkle: What was it? Dusty Pages: Freedom  Spike: From books? Dusty Pages: From perfection! I was too stubborn to know  when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I  wasn't living the life I wanted! Twilight Sparkle: You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you wanted to? Dusty Pages: Twilight, your late book was the best thing  that ever happened to me  Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail  at  In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it  right! Twilight Sparkle: You're sure you don't want to return it <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> get that perfect record back? [splat] Twilight Sparkle: [strangled scream] Dusty Pages: Ah, good  It was a yellow one  You can still see the words  Twilight Sparkle: But it'll have a stain! Dusty Pages: That doesn't change the truth inside it  Wait  Did you even read that thing? Twilight Sparkle: Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't  [splat] Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "Perfection"  Dusty Pages: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> the next part? Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit"  Spike <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Dusty Pages: [laughing] Twilight Sparkle: Oh  That might've been useful to look at earlier  First Folio: Uh-huh    Your total late fees come to    Twilight Sparkle: However much it is, I'll cover it  Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan? First Folio: <span style="background-color:yellow">Twenty</span>-eight bits  Twilight Sparkle <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Spike: [gasps] Spike: That's it?! First Folio: Yah-huh  Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month  Probably 'cause we don't tell them  [snorts] [bits clinking] First Folio: Thank you  Your account is back to normal  Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture  Twilight Sparkle: Um, is that really necessary? Heh  It just seems so permanent  Heh  I mean, I did return the book, after all  Spike: [clears throat] Twilight Sparkle: Okay  Letting the perfection go  [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you? First Folio: No, it's an old edition  We've already replaced it with a new copy  Spike: In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around  First Folio: You sure? It's got a stain  Twilight Sparkle: That's what makes it perfect  [credits]			<br>

Fluttershy: [giggles] Twilight Sparkle: Next item <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes  Spike?

Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together  Rainbow Dash: Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> teamwork  Applejack: [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me  Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better"  Just a little more qualified  No <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fense  Fluttershy: Maybe you can lead the field trip together  Applejack: [stutters] Rainbow Dash: [stutters] Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> course!

Applejack: Shed buildin'!   Rainbow Dash: Canoe racing! Silverstream: No    way  We get to do both?! Twilight Sparkle: I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind  Why don't you start with shed building first? Applejack: Heh  Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader! Twilight Sparkle: I'll check in later to see how it's going  Remember to work together! Applejack: [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath  What do you smell? Gallus: [inhale] Uh, yak?

Any questions? Yona: Uh, Yona has questions  Rainbow Dash: No time for 'em! Get in the boat! Applejack: You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month trophy? Rainbow Dash: I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> cutting wood  [splashing] Yona: Yak not like water  Ocellus: Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle  Yona: [weak whistling] Gallus: We got you, Yona  Yona: [yelping] [thud] Applejack: Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer  Rainbow Dash: We'll see about that  Rainbow Dash: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies! Applejack: Stroooooke    Stroooooke    Stroooooke    Slower    Focus on your paddle technique, y'all  Silverstream: Woo-hoo! We're really going now! Smolder: So    when do we get to the part when we move? [water splashing] Rainbow Dash: When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my activity, Applejack! Now stroke! [water splashing] [water rushing] [watch ticking] Rainbow Dash: Dig in, team! We can still beat that record! Applejack: Stop! Rainbow Dash: Go! Ocellus: Which way do we go? Rainbow Dash: Left! Applejack: Right! Silverstream: Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what? Rainbow Dash: Left! I can see the finish line from here! Applejack: If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish! Rainbow Dash: Who cares about a few fish? S<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>bar: Uh, pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essors?

Yona: [panicked whistling, coughing] Twilight Sparkle: How's the canoeing    going? Smolder: About as good as the apple shed building  Rainbow Dash: I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up! Applejack: I did not! Rainbow Dash: Did too! Applejack: Did not! Gallus: Yup  It's been like this all day  S<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>bar: I wouldn't say all day  Just    ninety-nine percent <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it  Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that! Rainbow Dash: We are! Mostly  Applejack: We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month is all  Twilight Sparkle: The Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month wouldn't care  about being the Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month! I know Fluttershy would be  thrilled to see another pony win  That's it! I'm taking over this field  trip! Applejack: H-Hold up, Twilight  Don't count Rainbow Dash  for the award just yet  You shoulda seen her fire up those students to  build a shed  Rainbow Dash: No way! You're the one the students listen to  Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish  [beat] Rainbow Dash: Uh, long story  But Applejack should definitely be Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month  Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm    Maybe you two have learned something, after all  Applejack: Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the— [muffled] Rainbow Dash: Field trip? Twilight Sparkle: Well    Rainbow Dash: Come on, Twilight  We get it  No more arguing  Right, Applejack? Applejack: Right as rain <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> twice as fresh! [ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>-bump] Twilight Sparkle: Fine  But I'm picking the next activity you two lead  A nature walk  Nopony could possibly argue over that  Right? Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Rainbow Dash: Right! Applejack: See? We're agreein' already  Applejack: Well, look at that  The path splits up ahead  Left or right? Smolder: Ugh  Here we go again  Applejack: Where to, Rainbow Dash? Rainbow Dash: I was thinking right    unless you want to go left  Because what makes you happy makes me happy  Applejack: Aw, heck  Forget about me  You want to go right, we'll go right  Rainbow Dash: But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you  Applejack: Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to you  Yona: Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way! Applejack: Hey! Where are y'all goin'? [montage music] Ocellus: I think we've gone in the same circle <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> times  S<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>bar: Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go  Rainbow Dash: Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack? Applejack: Up to you, Rainbow Dash  I insist  Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] No, no  I insist  Applejack: Heh  But I insisted first  Silverstream: Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost  Smolder: Ugh  [whoosh] Smolder: We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> stop doubling back  Rainbow Dash: We knew that  All part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> our plan  Right, Applejack? Applejack: Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh    build a  bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> we're home free  That is,  if-if you think a bridge is a good idea  Rainbow Dash: Only if you want to build a bridge  Gallus: Stop! Listen  We can just fly everyone over <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> be done  Applejack: Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork  Rainbow Dash: Cooperation! Applejack: Togetherness! Rainbow Dash: You are so right! Applejack: Only as right as you are! Smolder: Okay! We'll build a bridge! What do we use? Applejack: Branches!   Rainbow Dash: Vines! [beat] Applejack: Vines!   Rainbow Dash: Branches! Applejack: I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it! Rainbow Dash: I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> story! [montage music] Ocellus: [yawns] [crickets chirping] Applejack: [muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa! Young Six: [gasps] Applejack: [grunting] Young Six: [sighs] [crack] Rainbow Dash: Why didn't I think <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> branches to begin with? They're so— [yelping]    easy to work with  Young Six: [gasps] [wind whistling] Applejack: [muffled] Come on now    [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash: Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to— [screams] Applejack: [screams] Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Rainbow Dash: [screaming] Help! Ocellus: Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something  [vines creaking] Rainbow Dash: [grunting] I can't get out! Applejack: Let me try  [grunting] [vines creaking] [teeth snapping] Rainbow Dash: Let me guess  Bite-acudas? [splashing] Applejack: Mm-hmm  [teeth snapping] Applejack: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> they look mighty hungry  S<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>bar: We gotta get our pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essors out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> there! Anycreature have a plan? Gallus: Leave 'em hangin'? Silverstream: What?! Gallus: I'm kidding!    Kinda  Ocellus: We need to work fast! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> together! [vines snapping] Smolder: But mainly fast  Applejack: I hate to admit it, but— [vines snapping] Applejack:    this whole mess is kinda our fault  Rainbow Dash: Yeah  No trophy is worth getting eaten over  Applejack: So what do ya say? You want to team up <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> get ourselves out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> this here pickle barrel? Rainbow Dash: I thought you'd never ask  Rainbow Dash <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Applejack: [screams] Ocellus: Aah! Don't worry  I'm just the distraction  Rainbow Dash: Ocellus?! Applejack: [sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f us! [splashing] Ocellus: [roars, chomp-chomp] [splashing] [vines snapping] Rainbow Dash <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Applejack: [screaming] Silverstream: Need a lift? Yona: Yak smash!

Silverstream: Yeah! Pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essors Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Rainbow Dash were such good teachers! Gallus: It was kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> crazy genius  They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do  Twilight Sparkle: Really   ? S<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>bar: It took us a while to get it  Smolder: Especially at the ravine  It would've been so much easier to just fly home  Silverstream: But instead, our pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is  Gallus: Yeah  That was super dangerous  Talk about commitment  Ocellus: We know it's too early to pick the Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month  But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Applejack  Twilight Sparkle: Thank you for telling me  I'm so glad  to hear your field trip was a success  I'll make sure to schedule  another one right away  Young Six: [cheering] Twilight Sparkle: [to Rainbow Dash <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you? Applejack: To tell you the truth    yeah  Rainbow Dash: Well, not all the time  I agreed with you for the whole nature walk  Applejack: Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Month award! Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Rainbow Dash: You were the one doing the "angling"! Applejack: [sc<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fs] You were more like f<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>anglin'! Rainbow Dash: What does that even mean?!

Twilight Sparkle: I said no magic  You were supposed to do it by ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> so I could work in a friendship lesson  Starlight Glimmer: Oh, I heard "set the table" <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> just kinda went for it  Twilight Sparkle: Well, if you hadn't used magic,  you'd have heard me say, uh    this plate represents your head, this  spoon is your heart, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> the knives    are sharp! Always be careful with  knives  [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually  setting the table  Starlight Glimmer: Should I    change it back? Twilight Sparkle: I just want to make sure you're ready  for this dinner  Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to  see how the friendship lessons are going! Starlight Glimmer: If it's just you, me, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Princess Celestia, why are there four seats? Twilight Sparkle: Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend  That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> how good a teacher you have  Starlight Glimmer: Well, I can't choose  I like all your friends  Twilight Sparkle: That's the best part! You have to make a new friend! Starlight Glimmer: New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Ponyville! Twilight Sparkle: Starlight! Starlight Glimmer: Kidding! [laughs nervously] [theme song] Starlight Glimmer: Let's see  Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria  Shouldn't be hard    Pinkie Pie: Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you! Pinkie Pie: Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs  Cake! [small splats] Mrs  Cake: How are you, dearie? Starlight Glimmer: Are you baking? Can I help? [magic whirls] Pinkie Pie: Wow, Mrs  Cake! Look what your new friend made you! Mrs  Cake: [chuckles] New friend  I like the sound <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>– [gasps] Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?! [splat] Mrs  Cake: [yelps <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> spits] Starlight Glimmer: Sorry    Pinkie Pie: [licks, swallows] In her defense, it is delicious! [chomps] [thump] [apples falling] Applejack: I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight  Meet Big Mac! Big McIntosh: Eeyup! Applejack: He's not much <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a talker  Big McIntosh: Nnope  Starlight Glimmer: Oh, that's too bad  I love a good conversation  [magic wisps] Big McIntosh: [motormouth]  Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa!  What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I'm so  articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! Annie Apple awoke <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> accidentally ate an auburn azalea! [screams] Make it stop! Applejack: [growls] Starlight Glimmer: I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk  Applejack: [growls] Starlight Glimmer:    <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically comm<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> ponies to act the way I want them to? Applejack: [growls] Starlight Glimmer: Alright, I'll change him back! Rarity: The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant  First impressions count a great deal, you know  Starlight Glimmer: I'm glad you all got past my first impression  Rarity: Well, everypony deserves a second chance  Ooh!  Now, I have a top-notch idea  I'm thinking pastel silk here <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> here  with a crinoline underneath  Starlight Glimmer: You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies? Rarity: Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling! Starlight Glimmer: When will it be ready? Rarity: Three weeks  Starlight Glimmer: Dinner's tomorrow  Rarity: Well then, how about a hat from the    [clears throat]    clearance bin? [fabric ripping] Starlight Glimmer: Ugh! Maybe not  Rainbow Dash: Heh  Nopony's gonna make friends with you because <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> your outfit  The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness  Starlight Glimmer: Like you? Rainbow Dash: Yeah, but you already know me, so    [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh  Sorry  Starlight Glimmer: Who's that? Rainbow Dash: [gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you! [sonic boom] Rainbow Dash: You coming or what? Starlight Glimmer: I guess my first question would be, "What's a Wonderbolt?" Rainbow Dash: [gasps] You've never heard <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?! Starlight Glimmer: [nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess    Rainbow Dash: Right  Angel: [giggling] Starlight Glimmer: You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind  Fluttershy: [sighs] [ponies chattering] Starlight Glimmer: [groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with me! [sighs] Okay, calm down  Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase  [more ponies chattering] Starlight Glimmer: [to herself] Stop stressing    Stop stressing! [long beat] [door opens <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> shuts] Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] This is just what I needed  Trixie: [sighs] Tell me about it  Starlight Glimmer: You ever have one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> those days? Trixie: For me, they're all one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> those days  Starlight Glimmer: [giggles] Trixie: I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville  Starlight Glimmer: I'm not from here either  I've been  trying to make friends, but it's not easy  They're not saying it, but I  think everypony knows about my past  I may have been a tiny bit     completely <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> utterly evil? Trixie: Ponies judge me on my past too  Starlight Glimmer: Finally, a pony I can relate to  Twilight Sparkle: Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon,  strawberry pick  I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the  greatest magic <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> all is proper silverware placement! [giggles] Starlight Glimmer: Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend! Twilight Sparkle: That's fantastic news! Starlight Glimmer: She's great! Twilight Sparkle: Great! Starlight Glimmer: She's powerful! Twilight Sparkle: Powerful? Starlight Glimmer: She's— Trixie: Hello    princess! Twilight Sparkle: Trixie?! Starlight Glimmer: You know each other? Twilight Sparkle: You could say that  Trixie: We've had our differences  What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I appreciate it  [pause] Twilight Sparkle: So, um, what brings you to Ponyville? Trixie: The Grrrreat <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trrrrixie  has come to perform a new stage show <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> illusion! I am calling it  "The Humble <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour"! Starlight Glimmer: [hushed] That's kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a mouthful  Trixie: [hushed] It's a working title  Twilight Sparkle: Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> your past, I'm not sure she's the best    first friend  Starlight Glimmer: But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right? Twilight Sparkle: <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> course  It's just    She wasn't the nicest pony  Starlight Glimmer: Well, you did say anypony, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you  Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] You're right  I trust you  Just be back in time for the dinner  Starlight Glimmer: Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it! Twilight Sparkle: I hope not  [sighs] Trixie: This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen! Cherry Berry <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Goldengrape: [unintelligible whispering]    did you see   ? Caramel, Shoeshine, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Sunshower Raindrops: [unintelligible whispering]    did you hear   ? Trixie: Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget  Starlight Glimmer: That's what I'm worried about  Trixie: [sighs] Starlight Glimmer: What is it? Trixie: I heard what Twilight said about me, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> she's right  I wasn't very nice  So I'd underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> if you didn't want to be friends  Starlight Glimmer: Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel! Trixie: Can you keep a secret? Starlight Glimmer: What are friends for? Trixie: [hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Twilight  She's just the best at everything, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I wanted to beat her at something! Starlight Glimmer: [hushed] Your secret's safe with me  Trixie: Thanks  Want to help me unpack my wagon? Trixie: I spend a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy  Starlight Glimmer: Maybe I can help  I'm pretty good at organizing stuff  Magic props, brainwashed crowds    Starlight Glimmer <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Trixie: [laughing] Twilight Sparkle: Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh! Starlight Glimmer: Uh, I'll catch up  I think there's something in my ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Trixie: Sure  The wagon's right around the corner  Twilight Sparkle: [hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend? Starlight Glimmer: [sarcastically] Great  Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way  Twilight Sparkle: Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here  [bush rustling] Starlight Glimmer: [deadpan] Nice to meet you  Twilight Sparkle: No, no! You can come out now! [dubstep playing] Twilight Sparkle: You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be  the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with  Celestia  You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change  Heh  Starlight Glimmer: So back at your castle when you said "I trust you", you meant "I don't trust you"  Twilight Sparkle: [nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you? [dubstep fades out] Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you  Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie  She's just like me  We have a real connection  Twilight Sparkle: That's kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> what I'm afraid <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Oh! What about her? [thump] Starlight Glimmer: Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony  Twilight Sparkle: But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that? Starlight Glimmer: Wow  Trixie was right  You're not really giving her a second chance  I wonder what that says about how you feel about me  Cranky Doodle Donkey: [snorts] [bird flapping] Twilight Sparkle: Oh! Now he'd be perfect! Starlight Glimmer: [groans] [thump] [dragging] Starlight Glimmer: I was thinking  You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true  You're better at magic  Trixie: Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts  Funny story  Don't need to get into it  Starlight Glimmer: I meant stage magic  Trixie: Well, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course! Great? Yes  Powerful? Obviously  But I'm not the best  As great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do – the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive! [silent film-type piano music <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> film reel flickering] Trixie: [narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it  <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f – my hero, Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>dini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the  open mouth <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  swallows you, you magically step out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a box on the other side <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the  stage! [film reel runs out] Trixie: Completely unharmed! Starlight Glimmer: That sounds very    Trixie: Dangerous? Starlight Glimmer: I was gonna say cool! Trixie: I knew I liked you for a reason  I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> swallowed by that manticore  Starlight Glimmer: Not if you could use real magic  Trixie: Obviously  Way to rub it in  Starlight Glimmer: No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you    [magic zap] Starlight Glimmer:    <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> make you appear in the black box! Trixie: I guess that would work    But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner  Starlight Glimmer: Hah  When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes  Maybe I could be your    magic show helper pony! Trixie: We call it "assistant" in the magician biz  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span>    nopony's ever <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fered to help before  Starlight Glimmer: Well, I'd be honored  Trixie: You may have just made my great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> powerful  magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna  blow them away tonight! Starlight Glimmer: [groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight  Trixie: Oh  Starlight Glimmer: Can I vent for a minute? Trixie: What are friends for? Starlight Glimmer: Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends  [sighs] I guess you were right  No second chances  Trixie: Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised  Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight  If you have  to go to the dinner, I completely underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  [dramatically] I just  hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without  my new assistant! [ice sculpture dripping] Twilight Sparkle: Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh,  any minute, heh  Any minute now    [nervous laugh] [forced] How about I  introduce everyone? Our friendship lessons are going so well! She made  three new friends! She has such great taste in friends  I don't know  where she would've learned that! [nervous laugh] Cranky Doodle Donkey: Starlight Glimmer? I thought you said "nosehair trimmers"! What's going on? I'm hungry! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> my nose is too hairy  [snorts] Twilight Sparkle: [nervously] Ha-ha, Cranky Doodle!  You're so funny! If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna check the kitchen  Maybe  she got lost amongst the, uh    artichokes! [nervous laugh] Twilight Sparkle: Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie  Pinkie Pie: So this is the Humble <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour? Applejack: Ain't that a mouthful <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> molasses  Trixie: It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my life! Excuse me  Our lives  Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner  Twilight Sparkle: Ahem? You just decided to skip our  dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment,  Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite  silverware placement?! Starlight Glimmer: Yes, but— Twilight Sparkle: This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie  Trixie: A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess?  It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not   Starlight had to choose between you <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> me, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> she chose me! Your pupil  chose me, so ha! I win! Starlight Glimmer: You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight  Trixie: Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught  up in the moment  I like you  Beating Twilight is just a bonus  [gasps]  Saying that didn't help, did it? Starlight Glimmer: I should've known  Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend  Why would you? [controlled sobbing] Trixie: Wait, it's not like that! I am your friend  [groans] Twilight Sparkle: Well, you won  I hope you're happy! Trixie: [sighs] Looks like the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show  Twilight Sparkle: Trixie? Trixie:    Which is exactly the way she likes it!  Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> that annoying pony who  wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't  feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces! [spotlight clanks] Trixie: [unenthusiastic] Come one, come all  Come <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  see the Pathetic <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Friendless Trixie's  "Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour"  [crowd confused] Trixie: It's a working title! [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true  A pony-eating manticore  [manticore roars] Fluttershy: [trembling] Trixie: [unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive  [crowd gasps] Trixie: [unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for  when I defy the beast's jaws <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> doom <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> appear inside that black box   [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  powerful assistant, who was also my great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> powerful friend! Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, when I first came to  Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  my own friends  I need to give you the same freedom  I shouldn't have  tried to pick <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> choose your friends for you  Just like me, you have to  make your own decisions <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> your own friends  Starlight Glimmer: But    what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you? Twilight Sparkle: From what I've seen, she's the real thing  [fuse lights] Twilight Sparkle: But it's not my place to judge  It's all up to you  [manticore roars] [fuse hisses] Trixie: Starlight? If you're out there <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> you still  want to be friends, let's be great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> powerful together! [slightly  echoing] Please? [cannon fires] [manticore roars] Trixie: [shrieks] [manticore swallows <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> belches] [crowd gasps] Fluttershy: [faints] [crowd confused] [magic zap] [crunch] Trixie: [woozy] Behold, the Peat <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Growerful Triskie   ! [thud] [beat] [crowd cheers] Trixie: [amplified] <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> now, I'm proud to introduce my  great <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> powerful assistant! [normal] <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> best friend  [amplified]  Starlight Glimmer! [crowd cheers] Twilight Sparkle: Trixie! Trixie: What do you want? Twilight Sparkle: I was wrong  I'm sorry  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I have to h<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> it to you  I could never have pulled <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f a trick like that  Trixie: Thank you, princess  [fireworks launch] [ice sculpture dripping] Cranky Doodle Donkey: How do you get your hair to do that all the time?

Whoo! It's gonna be great! [train whistle blowing] Applejack: That's us  See you later! Spike: Now can we open presents? Applejack: But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve  Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow  Twilight Sparkle: When Spike <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I spent our first  Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his  presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before! Spike: It's kinda like our tradition! Applejack: That's not how our family does it, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it  Is it? Pinkie Pie: No sirree! Twilight Sparkle: To each their own, I suppose  [train whistle blowing] Pinkie Pie: Agh! Gotta go, bye! Spike: [straining] [paper tearing] Spike: Just what I always wanted! A book    [theme song] [train engine noises] Porter Pony: Chancellor Puddinghead puddings! How 'bout a Windigo-frosted snow cone? Applejack: It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one ro<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>! Pinkie Pie: Apples <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pies together again for the first  time! Maybe  Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not  I think I  just confused myself  Applejack: Friends or family, this here's about togetherness  Apple Bloom: [mouth full] Have you tried the Equestria  flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> don't tell Granny I saw, but her  trunk is full <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> presents!

Apple Bloom: Uh-oh  That's your boring sisterly lecture voice  Granny Smith: [snoring in background] Applejack: 'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> unicorn ponies weren't friends  Pinkie Pie: [as unicorn pony] I don't like you! [as Pegasus pony] I don't like you either! Applejack: But then, the icy chill <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Windigos  almost iced up everythin'  So the ponies decided to work together, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  their friendship drove them nasty critters away  Pinkie Pie: [as Pegasus pony] Beat it, Windigos! Applejack: Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Equestria was born  [biting sound] Applejack: Uh, what happened to the flag? Pinkie Pie: [chewing, with mouth full] I don't know    [swallows, licks] Apple Bloom: Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow? Applejack: Mm-hmm! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> our ancestors  Pinkie Pie: We do that too!

Applejack: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> tomorrow, we open presents! Pinkie Pie: Ah! We do that too! Apple Bloom: Sounds like the Apples <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> the Pies do everything the same way! Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pinkie Pie: [simultaneously] <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span>  course! We might be related! Hey, I was gonna say that! Stop sayin' what  I'm sayin'! You stop it first! [beat] [laughing] [train whistle blows] [train braking] [train whistle blows] Pinkie Pie: I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am  What about    "ro<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>tastic"?

"Iggy"? <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I'm just gonna call  you "Big Mama Q"! Limestone Pie: Gaze into the eyes <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Limestone Pie  Ma <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running  Cross me <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>— Pinkie Pie: Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine! Limestone Pie: Or Holder's Boulder! Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder  There, you happy now? Applejack: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> you must be— Pinkie Pie: This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's  only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me,  isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> she wishes  you all a happy Hearth's Warming! [beat] Marble Pie: Mm-hmm  Applejack: [hushed, to Apple Bloom] Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her  Apple Bloom: [giggles] Pinkie Pie: [whistles] Attention! Limestone Pie: What'd I say about the boulder?! Pinkie Pie: I'll just be a second  Everypony get settled  in! There's plenty <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> room upstairs  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> then it's time for Hearth's  Warming Eve dinner! [confetti exploding] Applejack: [hushed] So far, so good, cousin! Pinkie Pie: Hee-hee! [bed springs bouncing] Apple Bloom: Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner  Granny Smith: I'm more <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a six-layer bean dip filly myself! Apple Bloom: I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours? Applejack: Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least  Pinkie Pie: Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert – it's me! [soup pouring] [splash] Applejack: What about hot rolls <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> mulled cider <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> double-baked pot pie? Granny Smith: Uh, what about six-layer bean dip? Maud Pie: [deadpan] We have rock soup  Pinkie Pie: Potato, po-tah-to  Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner  Am I right or am I right? [beat] Applejack: Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony? Big McIntosh <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Granny Smith: [uncertain noises] Applejack: [laughs nervously] Pinkie Pie: [slurping, exhales] Is everything all right, Applejack? Applejack: O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle  Tune me up <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> let's get back to dinner  [slurping] [gag, coughs] Pinkie Pie: More rock, please! [soup pouring] Pinkie Pie: Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls! Applejack: Now that's somethin' I know all about! [picking noises] Pinkie Pie: Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll? Applejack: Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll? Pinkie Pie: Don't be silly, silly! [picking noise] [crumbling] Pinkie Pie: Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie? [beat] Marble Pie: Mm-hmm  [picking noises] Apple Bloom: Our dolls are    rocks? [snap] [crunch] Applejack: Uh    y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family? Pinkie Pie: Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock  Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission! Applejack: The what findin' what now? Pinkie Pie: Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac,  Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Maud, you're team two! Ma,  Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith  Don't think <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it as team old  Think <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it as team three! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I'm with Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course, since we might be cousins! Applejack: So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'? Pinkie Pie: As everypony knows— Limestone Pie: Stay <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f Holder's Boulder! Pinkie Pie: Sheesh  When the three tribes united to form  Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble  It's tradition to  raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day  Other ponies: [general agreement] Pinkie Pie: But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder? Applejack: You mean on the flagpole? Pinkie Pie: No, silly, it goes on the highest point! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> who's the lucky pony? Applejack: Traditionally, it's the youngest— Pinkie Pie: [quickly] On your marks, get set, go! Applejack: Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on? Pinkie Pie: I'll explain on the way! Applejack: [yelps] Applejack: I still don't underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  Pinkie Pie: Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone  Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag! Applejack: It's all just so    complicated, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>    rock-based  Pinkie Pie: Well, how else would we do it? Applejack: I don't know  I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time  Marble Pie: Mm-hmm  Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Marble Pie: Mm-hmm  Big McIntosh: Eeeeeeeeeyup  Granny Smith: So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller? Cloudy Quartz: We were chosen by the Pairing Stone <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> betrothed within a fortnight  Igneous Rock: The choosing stone decreed, "Thou shalt love one another " <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> lo, it was so  Granny Smith: Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing  You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks? Igneous Rock: Indeed so  Cloudy Quartz: [simultaneously] Mmm  Apple Bloom: What does the rock look like? Maud Pie: [deadpan] It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly  Apple Bloom: Oh  Maud Pie: [deadpan] Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock? Apple Bloom: I had a dream once I was an apple  Maud Pie: [deadpan] We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things  Pinkie Pie: Found it, found it, found it! Applejack: A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie! Pinkie Pie: Um, that would be weird  Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> now it's time to hide the presents! Applejack: Y'all hide your presents? Pinkie Pie: <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one  Applejack: So nopony gets presents? Pinkie Pie: Eh, not usually  Applejack: So lemme get all this straight  You're only  allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock  gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole,  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> to top it <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f, you don't even get presents?! Pinkie Pie: Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way  Applejack: Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag   ? Pinkie Pie: Picturing it    Loving it   ! Pinkie Pie: Goodnight, everypony! Applejack: Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'! Granny Smith: Is that really what she said? Applejack: Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant  Apple Bloom: These are their traditions  Big McIntosh: Eeyup  Applejack: [sighs] I know they have their traditions <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be  [rooster crows] Pinkie Pie: Hearth's Warming! [thump] Pinkie Pie: Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's— [strangles out] Igneous Rock: Oh, my  Oh, my  Limestone Pie: What  Happened  To  My  Farm! Applejack: It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've  been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit!  Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because  you're the youngest Pie! Ma <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll  never forget! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em! Pinkie Pie:    Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said  Right, everypony? Igneous Rock: Pinkamena Diane Pie! Truly thou cannot favor this madness! Pinkie Pie: Well, I wanna be one big family! Limestone Pie: But what about what we usually do?! Pinkie Pie: I, um, well, I-I don't know! [tearing up] Don't make me choose! Applejack: I didn't mean to cause a fuss    Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see! Maud Pie: Excuse me  You planted your pole on a fault line  [rumbling, cracking, thud] Limestone Pie: Nooooooooooooooo! [crunch] Applejack: Oh, boy  [bell ringing] Pinkie Pie: You didn't have to ask them to leave! Limestone Pie: They wanted to go! We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family! Pinkie Pie: This was all a misunderst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>ing, everypony! I know Applejack, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> she'd never do anything bad to anypony! Limestone Pie: Look around, Pinkie Pie! It's gonna take  me ages to get this rock farm back on track! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> how are we gonna lift  Holder's Boulder?! This is all her fault! Pinkie Pie: Then it's my fault too    [thud] Granny Smith: Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet  Apple Acres  Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's  best if we give them a little space  Apple Bloom: I wish we didn't have to  I really like Maud  She's sweet once you get to know her  They all are  Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever  Granny Smith: Eh, has anypony seen Applejack? Applejack: [sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time  Pinkie Pie: [sniffling] I really popped the piñata this time  Applejack: Pinkie Pie? Pinkie Pie: [yelps] What are you doing here? Applejack: What are you doin' here? Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pinkie Pie: [simultaneously] I came here to think! You did? So did I! [laughing] Aww  Applejack: I'm too ashamed to go back up there  Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop  Pinkie Pie: Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean    Oh, I'm not helping  Sorry  Applejack: I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours  I  don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> the friends who love you like one  I really hoped we could be one  big happy family  I guess not  Pinkie Pie: Don't say that! [train whistle blows] Applejack: I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch  Pinkie Pie: [crying] H-Ha    Happy Hearth's Warming  Applejack: [tearing up] You too  [train noises] Granny Smith: You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so  danged important? [exhales] Well, now their  great-great-great-great-great-great-gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>father Holder Cobblestone – he  found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built  the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock  It  always brought them good luck  Applejack: Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em! [smack] Applejack: [reading] To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie  Cousins forever  Apple Bloom: You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever! Applejack: [laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train     What a great tradition  [beat] Stop the train! Pie family: [straining] Pinkie Pie: [straining] Come on    you    boulder, come on    agh! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'm pushing as hard as I can too  Pie family: [straining] Limestone Pie: Rrrgh, it's hopeless! Applejack: Need a little help? Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Apples! Limestone Pie: What do you want?! Applejack: I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away,  I was tryin' to share ours  I was so focused on us bein' one big happy  family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away  What I  should've done was learn about yours <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> teach you about ours  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> over  time, we'd make new traditions together  I'm sorry, y'all  [beat] Limestone Pie: Well, don't just st<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> there! We got a boulder to move! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I'm in charge  Apple family <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pie family: [straining] Pinkie Pie: I think we've just invented our first  combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the quarry!  [squeals] I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's  Warming! Apple family <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pie family: [laughing] Apple Bloom: [swallows] Pinkie Pie: Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> you too, right, Big Mac? Marble Pie: Mm-hmm! Big McIntosh: [short giggle] Eeyup  Granny Smith: Eh, lemme see here, uh    'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'  Igneous Rock: 'Yee-haw'  [paper ripping] Pinkie Pie: Happy Hearth's Warming! Applejack: Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie  Apple Bloom: Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote! Apple family <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pie family: [various cheers] Maud Pie: [deadpan] The first one is about rocks  They're all about rocks  [reading, deadpan] Hearth's Warming is great  Like calcium silicate  What a wonderful day  As good as mica or clay  [carol-type music plays over credits]			<br>

Rarity: Probably from all the dust up here  [blows, coughs] Pinkie Pie: Aw, this room's not so bad  All it needs is some balloons, streamers    [humming] <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span>    a piñata!

[ponies murmuring] Fluttershy: Why is everypony looking at us? Applejack: Maybe they recognize Rainbow Dash  Rainbow Dash: Or Princess Twilight  But probably me  Rarity: No  I think they're staring because we're the only part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> this town that isn't    gray  Pinkie Pie: Whadaya mean? Rarity: Look around  All the colors here are gone! Twilight Sparkle: That's so strange  It's just like I noticed about Petunia last night  Everything's mostly gray  Petunia Petals: Oh! Hellooo! Applejack: Except the stuff that's grayer  Fluttershy: Oh, my  I knew something was <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span>, but— Rainbow Dash: This is so weird! Man Pony: Huh? Rarity: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> the way they're gawking at us, it appears they think we're the odd ones  Fluttershy: Maybe they don't even notice  It might be rude to mention it  Twilight Sparkle: I wonder what caused this  Applejack: We can ask the mayor  Rainbow Dash: Yeah, if we ever find him  [ponies whispering] Barley Barrel <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pickle Barrel: [grunting] Barley Barrel: Quit shoving! Pickle Barrel: Shoving? These are pro-level moves I'm doing, sis  Yeah— Ohhh! Barley Barrel: C'mon! Let go! Barley Barrel <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pickle Barrel: [gasp, grunt, gasp again] [angelic choir] [beat] [zip!] Barley Barrel <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pickle Barrel: [whispering indistinctly] Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: [upper-class accent] Don't pout, dear  It'll wrinkle your withers  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: [upper-class accent] I'm not pouting, sweetums, but I am hurt by your comment  I thought the pie I baked was quite tasty  Mrs Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: I didn't say it wasn't  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: You didn't say it was  Mr  <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Oh!

Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh! Heh  Ya spotted that, did ya? Well, it's a    long story  Uh, why don't I show you the town highlights first? Mane Six: [confused reactions] [plop] Mayor Sunny Skies: Here's our famous outdoor spa with the all-natural mud bath  Pretty, huh? [plop] Rarity: Ah! Ugh  Twilight Sparkle: Maybe we could see some <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Rainbow Festival activities from the brochure  Mayor Sunny Skies: O' course! The bakery booth is there    Fluttershy: Huh? Twilight Sparkle: Hmm? Mayor Sunny Skies: Or    will be  We're    still settin' up, but we gotta lotta great things planned  Fluttershy: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span>    the butterfly garden? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, that's right over here  Twilight Sparkle <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Applejack: Huh  [paper falling] Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, uh, lemme fix that  Fluttershy: So none <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the butterflies are actually    Mayor Sunny Skies: Real? Oh, no  Uh, what with the flowers not havin' color <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> all, the butterflies don't really come around much anymore  Applejack: I'm almost afraid to ask, but the brochure mentioned fishin'? Mayor Sunny Skies: Fishin'? Oh, I'm not sure whatcha mean  Twilight Sparkle: "Our famous rainbow trout"? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, yah, sure! Uh, well, uh, you  don't fish for him exactly  You just kinda, uh, talk to him  Uh, he's  right over, uh    [sighs] That's funny  Where'd our trout go? Trout Pony: Oh, Mr  Mayor! Uh, just, uh, taking my lunch now, okay? [slurp!] Mayor Sunny Skies: [chuckles nervously] Pinkie Pie: Um, so no big deal – well, actually, okay,  yes, kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a big deal – but the brochure also mentioned a karaoke  contest? [blink, blink] Mayor Sunny Skies: Right here! [sign falls] [thud] [microphone feedback] Mayor Sunny Skies: The trout doubles on harmonica  Trout Pony: [toots harmonica] Fluttershy: How    multitalented <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> him  Pinkie Pie: Good thing I bring my own karaoke party! With me wherever I go Whoa, whoa-oh!  Mayor Sunny Skies: Well, uh    that's the big tour  [hums] Twilight Sparkle: Mayor Skies  Mayor Sunny Skies: Eh? Twilight Sparkle: I don't underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  Your Rainbow Festival isn't quite as you described  Rainbow Dash: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> the resort hotel wasn't what it was cracked up to be either  Applejack: 'Cept for all the cracks  Rarity: None <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> these things are as pictured in your brochure  Mayor Sunny Skies: Well, maybe I exaggerated a little,  but I-I'd intended on havin' everythin' ready  It's just kinda hard  gettin' anypony excited about anythin' in this town anymore! Ugh  I didn't think ya'd come if ya knew the truth  Twilight Sparkle: The truth? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh    There is no Rainbow Festival! Mane Six: [gasp] Applejack: No Rainbow Festival?! Rainbow Dash: No fan club?! Mayor Sunny Skies: Believe me, I didn't mean to— Rainbow Dash: Bring us here for nothing?! Twilight Sparkle: Think <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> all the papers I could be grading! Mayor Sunny Skies: If ya just let me— Rarity: We should just leave this very moment! Applejack: Balloon's not fixed yet  Fluttershy: Maybe we should let the mayor explain  Mayor Sunny Skies: [clears throat] Uh, guess I should  start at the beginnin'  A long time ago, when my Gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>pa Skies was  mayor, Hope Hollow was <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span>  They used to call this town "The End  <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the Rainbow", 'cause everything you'd ever want, you could find right  here  [Mayor Sunny Skies] Next door neighbors chatting over white-wood fences Stoppin' on the street to say hello When friends did well, we sang their praises Brought soup to comfort them when they felt low That was our town at the end <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the rainbow No pots <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> gold or buried treasure Just everypony looking after each other The truest riches cannot be measured It was a lesson that had kept us together In our town at the end <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the rainbow To honor our fine town, my Gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>pa Skies decided To throw a party each <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> every year They planned for weeks, cooked for days, celebrated fifty ways So everypony would gather here In our town at the end <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the rainbow Gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>pa made a gizmo called the Rainbow Generator To paint the sky with lots <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> colors shining bold <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> bright To remind us all together we are greater <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> darkness never wins against the coming <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the light Gr<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>pa passed it on to Dad, then it was my turn To make the pretty rainbows in the sky It filled my heart with pride to see our whole town gathered gratefully Where we were sure there would never be An end to the rainbow Then fences went up, we lost track <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> our neighbors Each year passing, dimming spirits all around The happy days came to an end Nopony had time to spend together in the town I thought I knew exactly what the festival needed A bigger, better rainbow would surely make them see it But the extra magic was too much for the Rainbow Generator <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I'm the one who brought the rainbow to an end That's how our town, our little pony town That's how our town saw the end <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the rainbow  Pinkie Pie: [bawls] That is the saddest story-song I've ever heard! Mayor Sunny Skies: I tried for a long time to get  everypony interested in the Festival again  To remember what it's like  to come together as a community <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> share the fun  But nopony even  bothered listenin'  That's why I wrote to you, Rainbow Dash  You  were my last hope  I figured if a pony <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> your stature came to town, it  would get everypony excited about puttin' on the Festival again  I mean,  "Rainbow"'s even part o' your name! Rainbow Dash: Mmm, yeah, I can see that  Twilight Sparkle: Mr  Mayor, what kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> magic did you use on the Rainbow Generator? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, I'm not sure  I didn't know what I  was dealin' with  I only wanted to help  But instead, I sucked all the  color outta the town  That billboard's one o' the only things that  didn't change  To me, it's a reminder <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> what we can be  Keeps the "Hope" in "Hope Hollow"  Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm  If I could find out the type <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> magic you used, I might be able to reverse the spell  Mayor Sunny Skies: Ya mean, you're gonna stay? Mane Six: [agreeing] Applejack: Heh  Nothin' we like better than a challenge, 'specially when it comes to helpin' ponies  Mayor Sunny Skies: You don't know how clam-happy this all makes me! Thank you kindly! Twilight Sparkle: We'll do whatever we can to bring back your Rainbow Festival  Mayor Sunny Skies: I won't fib to ya, it won't be easy  It's gotten so nopony even talks to each other anymore  Twilight Sparkle: Mmm, it might be tough, but we have a little experience bringing ponies together  Pinkie Pie: Yay! This is exactly like planning a party! Only bigger, 'cause it's a festival! [giggles] Which means more cupcakes! Whoo-hoo! Ooh  Ah! I've got a date with the Bakery Booth! Ha-ha! [zip!] Pinkie Pie: [giggling rhythmically] Fluttershy: Um    I'd better go with her  Rarity: Hmmm, an overall stylistic look to unify the sentiment <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the celebration  That's what this festival needs  Mayor Sunny Skies: Ya mean like a rainbow? Rarity: Yes, darling, yes, yes, but more complex, more thematic, something like— Ooh! something like that! Formidable! Twilight Sparkle: The biggest challenge is getting your  town interested in a Rainbow Festival when everything's so    gray  I  think if we can bring the color back, it'll solve everything  Mayor Sunny Skies: Yah, I'm with ya there, but— Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, I need your help  Rainbow Dash: Mr  Mayor, seriously, is there a fan club? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, you betcha! They're around    somewhere  Rainbow Dash: Ugh  Applejack: Any tools I can borrow, your Honor? I'm gonna  spruce up that billboard to let everypony know this here Rainbow  Festival's back in business! Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, that's music to my ears! Torque Wrench, let's get our guest tooled up, whadaya say? She's gonna put our rainbow back up  Torque Wrench: [sarcastically] Oh, yippee  [music] Petunia Petals: Heh-heh  Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh! Uh, if ya don't mind, I, uh, I have a speech to work on  See ya 'round  Applejack: Hmm  Rainbow Dash: So    what's your plan? Twilight Sparkle: If magic caused this, maybe magic can solve it  [music] [magic sounds] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Oh, I was afraid <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> that  I've never seen any magic like this before  Rainbow Dash: Heh  Let me try  I mean, "Rainbow"'s part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my name, right? [music] [whooshing] [boom!] [ponies exclaiming] Rainbow Dash: Ugh  Yeah, that's all I got  Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Thanks for trying  I guess I need to do more research  [whooshing] Barley Barrel: Look out! Pickle Barrel: No, you look out! Barley <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pickle Barrel: [screaming] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Barley <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pickle Barrel: [grunt] Pickle Barrel: [groans] Rainbow Dash: Are you okay?

Pickle Barrel: I didn't zig! You zigged! I zagged! Barley Barrel: That's no excuse for—! Rainbow Dash: Guys, guys, hold on! It was just an accident  Pickle Barrel: An accident that happened in front <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you  Barley Barrel: Ugh, I'm so embarrassed  All <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> our lives, we've been wanting to meet you, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>— Rainbow Dash: Wait  So you're the fan club?

[whoosh!] Barley Barrel: Did you hear that?! Pickle Barrel: She called us "future Wonderbolts"! [whoosh!] [magic sounds] Applejack: I think some o' this can be saved, but we'll need some fresh lumber  Uh, Torque, the mayor said maybe you could lend a ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Torque Wrench: [groans] Him <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> his crazy schemes  What's your business in this anyhoo? Hmm? Applejack: Well, for one thing, we're helpin' the mayor  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> for another, Granny Smith always says, "You break somethin', you fix it  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> any job you do, you should be proud <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> " Torque Wrench: [laughs] Proud <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> bein' the repairpony?

[music] Rainbow Dash: You'll get there  But first, let's start with a single flip  Barley <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pickle Barrel: [gasp] [magic sounds] Fluttershy: If you don't mind my asking, you don't sound like the other ponies here in town  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Oh, we weren't born here  We're originally from Manehattan  Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: But it was so big  All those ponies crammed together, never talking to each other  Ooh  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: We heard Hope Hollow was just the opposite, so we moved here  Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> it was wonderful    uh, for a while  Fluttershy: What happened? Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Uh, things changed  Oh! Here  This is the tree  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: This is where the apricots in my pie came from  [beat] Pinkie Pie: Well, I'm no expert, but I don't think these are very ripe  Apricots are supposed to be orange  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Well, that's the problem, isn't it? With hardly any colors in this town, one apricot looks like another  Fluttershy: What about that tree? Its apricots are big <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> juicy  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Oh  We can't use the apricots from that tree  Pinkie Pie: Sure ya can! All you gotta do is— Moody Root: Hey! Stay away from my tree! Fluttershy: W-What was that? Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Just old Moody Root  Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: He's made it quite clear he won't share his apricots  He hasn't even said "hello" in ages  Fluttershy: Have you tried saying "hello" to him? Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: What? Well, no, but— Fluttershy: Mr  Moody Root, are you there? Moody Root: Who wants to know? Fluttershy: I'm Fluttershy  Your apricot tree is beautiful  So healthy  You must take very good care <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it  Moody Root: Well, I try to  Plant food  A good water now <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> then  Keeps my apricots happy  Fluttershy: I bet that's why you have so many <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> them  You must always be busy making things  Jam, cobbler, pie    Moody Root: Nope, I just eat 'em  Although, pie does sound pretty good  Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: What in Equestria is she doing? Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: I haven't the foggiest, dear  Pinkie Pie: Doing what she does best  Fluttershy: Your neighbors were just about to bake some pies  You know them, right?

We'd be happy to bake you a pie  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Two or    three pies even  Moody Root: So ya mean if I give ya my apricots    Pinkie Pie: [gasps] What a great idea! Fluttershy: Then everypony can share  What do you think, Mr  Moody Root? [sloop!] Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Ugh  Oh, well  Fluttershy: Wait for it    [music building up] [gate opens] Moody Root: Got a ladder? We can just pick 'em from your side <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the fence! Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Um, yes, <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> course! Uh, this way! [magic sounds] [music] [pages flipping] Twilight Sparkle: A prism curse? An erasure spell? None <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> these are big enough to make a whole town lose its color on their own! Ugh! Unless    Mayor Sunny Skies: [muffled] Oh, for the love o' cheddar! Twilight Sparkle: Huh? Mayor Sunny Skies: [muttering] Twilight Sparkle: Mayor Skies  Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh! Twilight Sparkle: What is all this? Mayor Sunny Skies: Princess Twilight! Welcome to our  town's Rainbow Room  Anything you want ta know about each year's  festival from the very beginnin'  Twilight Sparkle: The pictures! They're in color! Mayor Sunny Skies: Sure are  Oh  Those are from happier times  Back when there still was a festival  Seems even though we  faded, the memory never did  I come here sometimes for inspiration  I  need plenty for this speech I'm writin'  Biggest one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> my life  [to  Petunia] Oh! Didn't see ya there! Petunia Petals: Sunny! I-I didn' know you were here  Mayor Sunny Skies: Uh, Uh, j-just leavin'  [chuckles] I-I gotta finish this  W-Well, uh, s-see ya later! Twilight Sparkle: Whoa  The festival was really something, wasn't it? Petunia Petals: Used to be wonderful  It brought the  whole town together for a long time, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> these pictures are from the  last festival  You can see it didn't go well  Twilight Sparkle: Right  The mayor's magic in the generator caused the colors to go  Petunia Petals: That's what Sunny thinks  He blames himself for it, but I'm still not convinced it was anythin' other than an accident! Twilight Sparkle: There's something strange about this  I just can't put my ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> on it  If only the Generator hadn't been destroyed    Petunia Petals: Not all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> it was  Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Petunia Petals: [grunts] Twilight Sparkle: Wow! Petunia Petals: I don't keep it out because I know it hurts th' mayor to see it  Twilight Sparkle: Mind if I borrow this? [music] Mayor Sunny Skies: [laughs] Great job! It's even better than it was before, don'tcha know? [ponies chattering] Pony #1: Rainbow Festival? Pony #2: Didn't know it was still goin' on  Mayor Sunny Skies: Sure is! Bigger <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> better than ever! I hope  Tell all your friends! Colt: Can we go, Mama? Pony #2: I suppose so  Why not? [magic sounds] Colt: [gasps, laughs] Twilight Sparkle: Mr  Mayor  [grunts] I hope you don't mind, but— Mayor Sunny Skies: Where'd ya find that? Petunia Petals: I gave it to her, Sunny  She has an idea  Mayor Sunny Skies: Best idea would just be to throw that thing in the trash heap  Twilight Sparkle: My theory is that the Generator  magnifies whatever magic it uses, makes it stronger  So if we could  rebuild it <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> use one <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the reversal spells I just read about, it  could work to bring color back to the town! Mayor Sunny Skies: Even if we could get it workin' again, which is quite a tall order    Applejack Not for a gifted repairpony who I just happen to know  Torque Wrench: Let me take a look-see  Yah, I could give 'er a go  Mayor Sunny Skies: Huh  I don't wanna get my hope up, but    yahoo! Torque Wrench: Don't worry  I'll get to work  Petunia Petals: Um, how's your speech comin', Sunny? I'd be happy to help you with it if you'd like  Mayor Sunny Skies: Uh, oh, no, you couldn't  Uh,  t-thanks, but, uh, I have to do a little mayor-type business, don'tcha  know? But I'll check back in a little bit to see how everythin's goin'  [zip!] Petunia Petals: Hmmm  He's actin' so peculiar  Applejack: From what I've seen <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the mayor, how can ya tell exactly when "peculiar" kicks in? [music] Moody Root: [chomping] Mm-mm-mm-mm! If I'd have known your pie was this good, I'd have given you those apricots ages ago! Mrs  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington did all the baking  Mr  Ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ington: Mmm, inspired by you, Snookums  Mwah  Moody Root: Say, the whole town should know about this here pie  Pinkie Pie: Oh, don't worry  They will  We're gonna give it away at the Rainbow Festival! Moody Root: Wait, what? There's still a Rainbow Festival? Fluttershy: Uh-huh  Moody Root: [laughs] [magic sounds] [ding] Torque Wrench: Well, here it is  Had to ho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>-build some <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the parts myself, but it's as good as new  Applejack: Hoo-wee! This looks amazin', Torque  Nopony else could have pulled this <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f  Twilight Sparkle: Thank you so much for your help  Torque Wrench: It was a real challenge, but turns out that was part <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the fun! [chuckles] [music] [magic sounds] Applejack: Whoa! D-Did y'all see that? Twilight Sparkle: Now we need to test it  Petunia Petals: Should we call the mayor? Twilight Sparkle: Might be best to make sure it works first  I'd hate to disappoint him  Applejack: Uh, Twilight, I think I saw— Twilight Sparkle: In a moment, Applejack  This is important  Applejack: Yeah, but— Twilight Sparkle: Turn on the Generator  Applejack: Oh  Okay  [clicking <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> whirring] Twilight Sparkle <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Petunia Petals: [gasp] Applejack <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Torque Wrench: [gasp] [machinery continues] [sheen!] Applejack: Huh! Well, look at that! Petunia Petals: Oh, isn't it beautiful? That's what the Generator has always done for years <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> years  Twilight Sparkle: Now we just add magic, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>    [boom!] Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Petunia Petals, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Torque Wrench: [sigh] [music] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] I'm sorry  I thought for sure it would work  Petunia Petals: Let's not tell the mayor  It would break his heart  Twilight Sparkle: No  We have to tell him we failed  We can't bring the color back  Applejack: Hmm    Twilight! I really think you should see this  You betcha— Pinkie Pie: We did it! Twilight Sparkle <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Petunia Petals: Huh? Applejack: [sighs] Pinkie Pie: [humming] Everything you need for the Rainbow Festival bake sale!

It is comin' back! [magic sounds] [ponies exclaim] [magic sounds continue] Pickle Barrel: Whoa! Fluttershy: What's happening? Rarity: Something wonderful! Twilight Sparkle: But how? It wasn't the Generator  Which means something else must have drained the town's color in the first place! I have to get back to the library! Twilight Sparkle: I thought so! Look  In the second photo, when the Generator goes <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>f, this pony is walking away  But on the third photo, when all the color's gone, he's back where he was  Which means    Petunia Petals: [gasps] We have to tell the mayor!

Petunia Petals: No, ya big do<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>us! How many times have I tried to tell ya that? All those years, ya blamed yerself for nuthin'  Twilight Sparkle: These photos from the library explain  everything  Once I realized they were out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> order, it proved that the  town's colors got dim before you turned on the Generator  Mayor Sunny Skies: Boy howdy, am I glad to hear that! But then, what did cause it? Twilight Sparkle: It's called "Hopeless Magic"   Everypony was already giving up each other, losing hope  Then, when the  Generator blew up, it must have been the last straw  It took all the  hope out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> the town for good, along with the color  But now there's a  <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> magic  <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> everypony coming together again  Just the  way you wanted it, Mayor  Torque Wrench: Whadaya know?

Apparently, she's a huge sports fan  Pinkie Pie: Always thought Celestia was kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> a jock, just with really wavy hair  Twilight Sparkle: Anyway, we don't have much time  The game is in two weeks, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I want all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> you to coach the team! [excited chattering] Fluttershy: [hyperventilating] Twilight Sparkle: I know how you feel  Young athletes ready to take the field  Ooh, you could almost breathe in the excitement! Fluttershy: [gasps] Snails: I don't think you should breathe it in so hard  [splash!] Fluttershy: It's just    Two weeks doesn't feel like a whole lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> time to train a whole team  Pinkie Pie: Mmmmaybe the School <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Magic could play a  few other schools first  Like the Mane <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Tail Styling College or the  Scroll-Making Institute? Twilight Sparkle: Relax  You're gonna do just fine  Fluttershy: Um, [gasps] what makes you so sure? Twilight Sparkle: Because I have faith in my friends, who also happen to be the best buckball players in Equestria! Pinkie Pie: Oh, yeah! [squeaks] [music] [smack!] [whoosh!] Fluttershy: I guess that is sort <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> true  Twilight Sparkle: I asked Rainbow Dash to help, too  But I'm not sure when she— [whooshes] Rainbow Dash: Sorry I'm late! But when Twilight said she  needed my help with the buckball team, I figured I'd better grab every  piece <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> coaching equipment I could find! So what should I focus on?  <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span>fense? Defense? Trick plays? Twilight Sparkle: I was thinking <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> something even more important  Rainbow Dash: Awesome! Lay it on me  Whatever it is, I'll give it a hundred <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent! Twilight Sparkle: I knew I could count on your enthusiasm! That's why I want you to coach the cheer squad! [thud] Rainbow Dash: Cheerleading?! [theme song] [music] Rainbow Dash: I don't mean to sound ungrateful  It's  just when you said you wanted my help with something important, I  thought you meant something important  Twilight Sparkle: The cheer squad is important  Rainbow Dash: [laughs hysterically] Oh  Well, sure,  cheer squad is totally important to somepony who isn't me  But I'm more  about ponies playing in the game, not cheering for it  [students laughing] Rainbow Dash: I mean, it's great that some ponies only want to cheer, though I don't know why they would  Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm  Well, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to find out  Rainbow Dash: <span style="background-color:yellow">Of</span> course I've seen cheer squads before –  on the sidelines – but I'm not even a hundred percent sure what they do   I'll probably just mess it up  Twilight Sparkle: I think you might be surprised  In fact, I'm more sure than ever that you're the perfect choice  Snips: I'm actually one hundred <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent sure  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> it's a good thing, too  The cheer squad really needs you  Rainbow Dash: What do you mean? Snips: Well, I've been helping out, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> let's put it  this way  We've got two weeks until the big game, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>    we could use  two years  But that's all gonna change because you're here to save the  day! Rainbow Dash: Okay    So why are you here? Snips: What? A pony can't show school spirit? Rainbow Dash: You don't even go to this school  Snips: Uh, okay  When I went to the Buckball Hall <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Fame, I found out buckball souvenirs are big bits  If Twilight's team  does well, I could start selling them full-time in Ponyville! So I have a vested interest, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> you have an assistant coach! [blows whistle] Rainbow Dash: Ugh  Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Shimmy Shake: [giggling] Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: [valley girl accent] She's here!

[Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>] [rhythmically] We wanna dance for each other <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> for all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> our friends!

[stomping] Ocellus: <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> I thought this could be my chance to make an impression on everypony  You know, for something other than changing shape  Rainbow Dash: I didn't realize you were into school spirit, Smolder  Smolder: Eh  I just came with these two  Guess they think you can make cheer squad cool or something  Rainbow Dash: Don't count on it  Snips: Okay! Now that we're all here, why don't you tell  us the plan? How are you gonna make us into the most awesome cheer  squad ever? Rainbow Dash: Eh    I'unno  Cheer Squad: [groan] Rainbow Dash: I mean, if you guys were an actual buckball team, I'd have plenty <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ideas  But I don't know anything about cheerleading  Snips: Oh! [laughs] Yes! Good one, coach! But Headmare  Twilight picked you for the job, so I'm pretty sure you know what you're  doing  Rainbow Dash: If you say so  Snips: [laughs] Right  Okay, gang, let's show Rainbow Dash what we've been working on, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> she can take it from there  Yona: Cheer squad can do that! [stomping] Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: Yup  All we need is a little music! [up-tempo music playing] Shimmy Shake: Over    <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> over    <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> over a   gain! [stomping] Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: We want to dance    for each other <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> for all <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> our friends! Smolder: [unenthusiastically] Two, four, six, eight  Ocellus: [quietly] Uh    friendship school is really    great  [stomping] [crash!] Smolder: Well, that was a disaster  Shimmy Shake: It's kind <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> hard to stick to our choreography when the floor is moving  Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: [sc<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fs] Yeah, Yona, your stomps are a little too powerful  Yona: Can we make pony pyramid instead? Ocellus: Maybe we should figure out what cheers we should do first  Smolder: [sc<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>fs, sarcastically] Yeah, because that'll fix everything  Snips: So, I mean, there's a few    uh, a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> problems, but nothing you can't solve, right? Rainbow Dash: Huh? Oh, yeah  Listen, you guys don't have anything to worry about  Smolder: We don't? Rainbow Dash: Nope  In fact, I think what you all just  did is totally fine  You guys have got this  So, uh, I'm just gonna head  down to the field  Uh, great practice, everypony! [whoosh] [door slams] Rainbow Dash: Ugh! What are you doing? Snips: [grunting] What are you doing?! You've got to come back <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> coach the squad! Rainbow Dash: I watched them cheer stuff  Looked fine to me  Snips: [grunts] Well, it's not! Do you know what'll happen if they do what they just did at the big game? Rainbow Dash: Uh, nothing? Snips: Uh, wrong! Rainbow Dash: Ooh! Snips: A good cheer squad gets the fans excited, which  gets the team excited  But if nopony's excited, then no    pony     buys    any    souvenirs! Rainbow Dash: I think you're blowing this a little out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> proportion  Snips: Point is, if I'm going to make any bits at these games, that squad has to get better  <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> to do that, they need a coach  Rainbow Dash: [gasps] You know what? You're right! Why don't you do it? I mean, you're the one with a vested interest  Snails: The trick to being a good buckball keeper is to do nothin'  Just empty your mind  Be the ball  Pizzelle: Uh, balls don't have minds  Snails: Exactly  [music] "November Rain": Uh, where's my blindfold? "Berry Bliss": My turn! Pizzelle: I want to do that! "Berry Bliss": Over here! Smolder: Why are you watching Snails' weird practice when you're supposed to be practicing with us? Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] Snails' practice is definitely weird  Uh, I thought Snips was practicing with you  Smolder: He was  Shimmy Shake: [sighs] Do you have any idea how hard it is to dance in this stuff? Ocellus: [s<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>tly] Plus all these buttons jingle so much, you can't hear my cheers  Smolder: Speaking up might help a little  Rainbow Dash: So don't dance <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> cheer  Yona: Uh, then what cheer squad do? Rainbow Dash: I dunno  Smolder: [angrily] Maybe you should! [calmly] Or whatever  You're the coach! You're supposed to come up with stuff for us to do  Rainbow Dash: Okay  I've got something for you to do  Snails: Just do nothing  Empty your minds  Be the squad  Smolder: We are the squad  Snails: Oh, yeah  Snips: At least helping sell my souvenirs was    something  Yona: Yona still not underst<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> how this make us better  Huh? Pr<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>essor Dash needs to stay <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> coach! Rainbow Dash: [groans] You guys asked me to come up with something, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> I did  Smolder: I don't think nothing counts  Rainbow Dash: Then I'm out <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> ideas  Snails: This is the School <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> Friendship  If you need ideas, you should ask your friends for help  Rainbow Dash: Ugh, fine  [montage music] [party cannon squeak] Rainbow Dash: Okay  Since you guys have been nagging me nonstop about this cheer stuff for, like, ever    Smolder: It has literally been one day  Rainbow Dash:    I went around <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> got everything you need! [music] Smolder: Uh, what're we supposed to do with hay? Rainbow Dash: Beats me, but Applejack seemed pretty sure about it  Oh, I almost forgot  Ocellus: A rhyming dictionary? Rainbow Dash: Yeah  Zecora's a lot less helpful than  you'd think  That's from the library so you can come up with cheers   Okay! Good practice! Smolder: So, you're just leaving again? Rainbow Dash: Ugh! Look  I talked to my friends, <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>  they said this is the stuff you need  Wouldn't a true cheer squad be  able to figure out what to do with it? Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: But Fluttershy <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Pinkie wanted us to show 'em everything we come up with tomorrow! Shimmy Shake: They want us to get the team all excited before the big game! Rainbow Dash: Well, then it's a good thing I got you all this stuff  You better get to work! [whoosh] [door slams] Snips: Don't look at me  [music] Fluttershy: Good work, everypony! Let's take a break! Rainbow Dash: [whistles] Yeah! [whistles] Wow! This team is really shaping up! Nice job! Fluttershy: Thanks  I'm excited to see what you've been up to  Pinkie Pie: Yeah! I can't wait to see the cheer squad! Rainbow Dash: [laughs hysterically] Oh  You're serious  Pinkie Pie: Woo-hoo! Go, team! This is so exciting! Fluttershy: Well, I'm sure you've put in a lot <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span> hard work  Rainbow Dash: How much work does cheer squad need? Snips: Anypony want to buy an <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>ficial School <span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>  Friendship cheer squad headb<span style="background-color:yellow">and</span>? Now I personally would buy them before  the performance! Pinkie Pie <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Fluttershy: Huh?

[creak] [party cannon squeak] Smolder: [blusters] Pinkie Pie: I know I said I couldn't wait to see the cheer squad, but maybe I could've waited just a teensy bit longer  Rainbow Dash: Oh, yeah! Nice one! Huh? What? Rainbow Dash: I don't know what everypony's so upset  about  So it wasn't great  Cheerleading's never great  That's why  everypony gets up to get a snack during it  Yona: [bawls loudly] Rainbow Dash: What is the big deal? Shimmy Shake: If you don't know, there's no point in us trying to explain it to you! Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: Lead dancers, out! Shimmy Shake <span style="background-color:yellow">and</span> Lightho<span style="background-color:yellow">of</span>: Hmph! Smolder: It's not that we were bad  It's that you didn't even want to try to help us get better! Rainbow Dash: I didn't try? What are you talking about?!  I got you a party cannon! It's not my fault you couldn't figure out how  to use it right  Ocellus: [loudly] Well, you could have shown us! [sobbing] Rainbow Dash: Whoa  Ponies might actually care about cheer squad if she cheered like that all the time  Smolder: Why would you say ponies don't care about cheer squad? Rainbow Dash: Because they don't  Smolder: No  You don't  But they do! I bet  Headmare Twilight does! <span style="background-color:yellow">And</span> you know what? I do, too! I actually got  excited when I found out you were gonna be our coach! I figured if  anypony can make cheer squad awesome, it's you! Rainbow Dash: Me? Why? Smolder: Because everything's always awesome with you! Or <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent cooler! Or whatever!
