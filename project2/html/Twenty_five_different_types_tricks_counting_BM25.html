Twilight Sparkle: Okay, here goes. [magical chime] Spike: Ha ha! Ya did it! Growing magic, that's number  <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>. <span style="background-color:yellow">Twenty</span>-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">types</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow">counting</span>. And I  think this is the best trick so far. Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw,  it's nothin', just my awesome mustache. [laughter] Twilight Sparkle: Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go. Spike: Wait! Aw, rats! Twilight Sparkle: [laughter] [theme song] Spike: <span style="background-color:yellow">Twenty</span>-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>, Twilight. <span style="background-color:yellow">Twenty</span>-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> kinds  of <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow">counting</span>. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a  little magic that matches their special talents! Twilight Sparkle: True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic? Spike: Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic. Twilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me. Spike: Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight. Snails: Gangway! Comin' through! Spike: Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on? Snails: Wha, haven't you heard? Spike: Whoa! Snails: There's a new unicorn in town! Snips: Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever! Twilight Sparkle: Really? Spike: Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here. Twilight Sparkle: Where is this unicorn? Snails: Ho, she's in the town square. Come on! Snips: Yeah! [laughter] Come on! Whooo! Trixie: Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie! Audience: Ooh! Trixie: Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes! [fireworks and fanfare] Rarity: My, my, my! What boasting! Spike: Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi— Twi— Twi— Oh! [clears throat] Hey, Rarity, I, uh— Mustache! Twilight Sparkle: There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there? Applejack: Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons. Rarity: Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us. Rainbow Dash: Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us. [laughter] Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo! Trixie: Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant  as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie?  Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical  unicorn in all of Equestria? Rarity: [raspberry] Just who does she think she is? Spike: Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is— Twilight Sparkle: Spike! Shhh! Spike: What? What's wrong? Twilight Sparkle: You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off. [fanfare] Rainbow Dash: So, "Great and Powerful Trixie". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway? Trixie: Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major! [fanfare, fireworks] Audience: Ahh! Snips: What? Snails: No way! Trixie: When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington  had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in,  and with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back  to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest! Snips and Snails: Saw, sweet! Snips: That settles it. Snails: Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville. Snips: No, in all of Equestria! Spike: How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi— [zip!] Mmph! M-mmph! Trixie: [laughter] It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville. [crickets] Trixie: Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?  [chuckles] Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians. Anything you  can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined  to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!? [fireworks and fanfare] Spike: [zip] Please! She's unbearable! Ya gotta show her! Ya just gotta! [cries] Twilight Sparkle: There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since— Trixie: Hmm, how about you? Twilight Sparkle: [gulps] [music] Trixie: Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't? Twilight Sparkle: I— I— Trixie: Well, little hayseed? Applejack: That's it! I can't stand for no more of this! Spike: You show her, AJ! Applejack: Can your magical powers do this? [banjo music] Audience: Whooo! [cheers] Applejack: Top that, missy. Trixie: Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie! [snake charmer music] Applejack: Whoa! Uh! Audience: [laughter and cheers] Trixie: Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails. Rainbow Dash: There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that. Trixie: Oh? Rainbow Dash: That's my job! [electric guitar music] Rainbow Dash: They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'! Audience: [cheers] Trixie: When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser. [rapid music] Rainbow Dash: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a! [gulp] I think I'm [gulp] gonna be sick. Trixie: Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie. [thunder] Rainbow Dash: Ow! [laughter] Spike: What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own. Rainbow Dash: Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss. Applejack: A real unicorn to unicorn tussle. Twilight Sparkle: Uh... Rarity: Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint,  but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave  like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace. Trixie: Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane? Rarity: Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with  all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your  brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn  needs to have style. Audience: Ooh! Rarity: A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty. Spike: Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's— Audience: [gasps] Rarity: Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair! Twilight Sparkle: Nothing. Rainbow Dash: It's fine. Applejack: It's gorgeous. Spike: It's green. What? Rarity: Ugh, no. Green hair! Not green hair! [cries] Such an awful, awful color! [cries] Golden Harvest: Well, I never! Spike: Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of. Twilight Sparkle: What do you mean? I'm nothing special. Spike: Yes, you are! You're better than her! Twilight Sparkle: I'm not better than anyone. Trixie: Hah! You think you're better than the Great and  Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on,  show Trixie what you've got. Show us all. Twilight Sparkle: Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill  citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear  my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go. Spike: Twilight? Trixie: Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie  has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria.  Huh, was there ever any doubt? Snips: Here's your smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it. Snails: Mmm, hay. Trixie: [sips] Yes? Snips: Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie. Snails: Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major. Trixie: Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning. Snails: Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie. Snips: Anything you say. We are at your beck and call. Trixie: Ah. Spike: What are you two doin'? Snips: Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a— Spike: The what? Snips: The Great and Powerful Trixie. Spike: Sheesh. Snips: Just bringin' her a smoothie. Spike: How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who— Snips: The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that? Spike: Oh really? Were you guys actually there? Snips: Well, eh, uh... no, but— Spike: But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding. Snails: [laughs] I like pudding. Spike: Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the  street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says,  and neither should you! Snips: Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Snails: Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas? Snips: Yeah, uh... oh, come on! Spike: Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me? Twilight Sparkle: Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's  bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the  risk of losing them as friends. Spike: It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends! Twilight Sparkle: No, Spike, it's exactly the same. Spike: Come on, Twilight, any one of these <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie. Twilight Sparkle: I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie. [door slam, door open] Spike: But you're the best! Twilight Sparkle: Uh. Please, Spike, I said no! Spike: [sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine. [door slam, door open] [spooky music and sounds] Snips: Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face? Snails: Hold on. [grunts] Snips: Oh, heh. That's better. [growl] Snails: Yaaaah! Snips: Yaaaah! Ursa: [roar] Snips: [screaming] Spike: Hey, guys, where ya goin'? Snails: [breathing hard] Snips: Can't talk now. Snails: Got a major problem! Snips: Yeah, ursa major, to be exact. [roar] Spike: Huh? Ursa: [roar] Snips and Snails: Trixie! Spike: Twilight! [banging on door] Snips and Snails: Trixie! [mingled speech] Trixie: Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed! Snips: [nervous laughter] We— We have a— a tiny problem. Snails: Actually, it's a big one. Trixie: What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie? [roar] Ursa: [roar] Trixie: [screams] Snips and Snails: [screams] Ursa: [roar] Spike: Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick! Twilight Sparkle: I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie! Spike: No, you don't understand, it's— [roar] Twilight Sparkle: Uh, is that what I think it is? Spike: Majorly. Snips: Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa. Snails: Yeah, vanquish so we can watch. Snips: It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here. Trixie: Wait, you brought this here? [gasp] Are you out of your little pony minds? Snips: But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie. Snails: Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major. Ursa: [roar] Trixie: Uh, okay. [gulp] Stand back. [snake charmer music] Trixie: Heh. Piece of cake. [growls, snap] Snips: Aw, come on, Trixie. Snails: Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh? Trixie: [gasp, gulp] Snails: Well, that was a dud. Snips: Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know. [crackle] Trixie: Uh-oh. Ursa: [roar] Snips, Snails, and Trixie: [screams] Ursa: [roar] [ponies gasp] Ursa: [roar] [crash] [ponies crying in fear] Twilight Sparkle: What's going on? Snips: We brought an ursa to town. Twilight Sparkle: You what!?! Snails: Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it. Trixie: I can't. Snips and Snails: What!? Trixie: Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better. Snips and Snails: Made it up!? Ursa: [growl] [roar] [ponies gasp] Twilight Sparkle: [gulp] Ursa: [growl] Twilight Sparkle: [groans] [wind] [music from broken cattails] Ursa: [growl] [grunt] [guttural sigh] Spike: Nice use of number sixteen. [metallic sounds] [water flowing] [milking sounds and moos] Unidentified cow: Golly, dont'cha know? Spike: That's new. [metallic clank] Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Ursa: [sucking] [cheering] Rainbow Dash: Unbelievable! Spike: That was amazing! Applejack: Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much! Twilight Sparkle: I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me. Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Rarity: Hate you? Rarity: Why, whatever do you mean, darling? Twilight Sparkle: Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>, and I just thought-- Rainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth. Rarity: Most unpleasant. Applejack: All hat and no cattle. Twilight Sparkle: So, you don't mind my magic <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>? Applejack: Your magic is a part of who you are,  sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful,  talented unicorn as our friend. Rainbow Dash: And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder. Twilight Sparkle: You are? Rainbow Dash: Uh-huh. Applejack: Mm-hmm. Rarity: Mm-hmm. Spike: Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major? Twilight Sparkle: That's what I was doing when you came  looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was  compelled to do a little reading up on them. Spike: So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself? Twilight Sparkle: That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa minor. Trixie: That was just a baby? Twilight Sparkle: And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because someone woke it up. Snips and Snails: Awww... Spike: Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like? Twilight Sparkle: You don't wanna know. Trixie: Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but  you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and  Powerful Trixie! [retreating hoofbeats] Rainbow Dash: Why, that little... Twilight Sparkle: Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two. Snips: Ah [nervous laughter]. Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor. Snails: We just wanted to see some awesome magic. Snips: Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome! Snails: We deserve whatever punishment you give us. Twilight Sparkle: For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>? Spike: Oh, <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too. Snips and Snails: Heah? Twilight Sparkle: I think you're right. Snips, Snails, and Spike: Sweet! Twilight Sparkle: Dear Princess Celestia, I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I  was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part  of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of  your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them  off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends. Spike: So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville? Twilight Sparkle: Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity? Spike: Eh, she didn't go for the mustache. Twilight Sparkle: You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself. Spike: Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard? Twilight Sparkle: Uh, not this again! Spike: Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin! [music] [credits]			<br>

			<a href="All Transcripts - My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki.html#FlighttotheFinish"><h3>Flight to the Finish</h3></a>Flight to the Finish Cheerilee: Today, we have two special guests with a very  special announcement! Everypony, welcome the head of the Equestria  Games, Ms. Harshwhinny! Ms. Harshwhinny: Thank you. Now, I'm sure you all know  about the Equestria Games, where ponies from all over the land compete  for glory in various athletic pursuits. Well, now you littlest ones will  have the chance to compete for a weighty responsibility of your very  own. Rainbow Dash: [distant] Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part! Students: [Oohing and ahhing] Rainbow Dash: That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms.  Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and  you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?! Diamond Tiara: It's gotta be me! Aura: Maybe it's me! Scootaloo: Maybe it's us! Snips and Snails: Maybe it's us! [creaking] [thud] Snips: Hey! It could happen! [theme song] Rainbow Dash: So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna love this! Ms. Harshwhinny: Ms. Dash, will you please curb your  over-enthusiastic outbursts? Now then, let me be clear on the rules. You  ponies will form teams. Each team will create their own flag carrying  routine. Everypony will be judged on grace, style and originality.  There's a most complicated scoring system, which I will elaborate upon  now. Firstly-- Rainbow Dash: Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell  'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach! [blows whistle] That's  right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who  carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little  filly? Me! I'll never forget it –- I burst into the stadium, spreading  my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span> with that flag  the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since! [thud] Ms. Harshwhinny: Professionalism, Ms. Dash. I must  insist. If you want to keep your job as coach of these ponies, you must  maintain a professional attitude and keep your emotions in check! Am I  making myself absolutely, one hundred percent crystal clear? Rainbow Dash: Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, "professionalism" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash. Ms. Harshwhinny: Hmph! Well, in three days time, Ms. Dash  will accompany anypony competing to the Crystal Empire, where you will  demonstrate your routines for me and the other judges, who will judge  you very professionally. Rainbow Dash: Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the  meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this  opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever  happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And  so am I! Wooho-- Ahem... Meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours.  Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here.  Professionally. See how professionally? Ms. Harshwhinny: Ugh. Ponies, the most important thing is this: Your routine needs to show what your town means to you. So, do Ponyville proud. Work hard, be bold, wow me. That is all! [school bell rings] [foals talking] Scootaloo: So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing? Apple Bloom: I'd say that's rootin'-tootin' terrific! Sweetie Belle: But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete! Scootaloo: Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry  that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you  in? 'Cause I'm in! Apple Bloom: Me too! [beat] Sweetie Belle: Me three! Scootaloo: Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right? Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Right! Scootaloo: So... what's special about Ponyville? It's...  It's... I got it! It's a place where <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> kinds of ponies live  together as friends! Apple Bloom: Earth ponies like me! Sweetie Belle: Unicorns like me! Scootaloo: And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act. Sweetie Belle: We're gonna need a plan. Apple Bloom: And a lot of hard work! Scootaloo: And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses! [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] We're the toughest little ponies in town Got the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around We are a trio, work as a team We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene We get going when the going gets tough We know our very best is just never enough We're kinda short, but so what? We don't get defeated We could take a little break, but we don't need it We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses When we put our minds together, we can achieve We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and you should believe We've got determination to represent the nation For the win We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory We can conquer any challenge we're in We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses Hearts strong as horses  Crusaders: Whoa! [thud] Crusaders: Oof! [clapping] Diamond Tiara: If that's the best you've got, we're going to win for sure. Silver Spoon: We already have the most divine routine planned. Diamond Tiara: It's absolutely sure to crush everyone else – and I mean crush. Scootaloo: But we're winners! And we have [starts singing] hearts-- Silver Spoon: Sure. But you know what you don't have? Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: Your cutie marks! Blank flanks, blank flanks, blank flanks! Apple Bloom: What does that have to do with flag carryin'? Silver Spoon: Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable. Diamond Tiara: And we, of course, already have our cutie marks. So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle. Scootaloo: Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games. Silver Spoon: May the best ponies win! Scootaloo: Game on! Rainbow Dash: Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good! Scootaloo: Don't worry, we will! Sweetie Belle: Now, this is just a little something we threw together. It's not perfect yet, not even close. Diamond Tiara: Let's watch the Cutie Mark "Goof-saders" do their saddle routine. Silver Spoon: They're gonna be a hot mess! Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [giggling] Scootaloo: Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three <span style="background-color:yellow">types</span> of ponies coexist! Apple Bloom: We are Earth ponies! Sweetie Belle: We are unicorns! Scootaloo: We are Pegasi! And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best... Crusaders: Ponyville forever! Yay! Scootaloo: It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think? Rainbow Dash: That was ama-- [in her head] Wait. Hold on now. Gotta stay calm, cool and collected. [out loud] To give a calm, clear analysis-- Wait. You whipped that act together just yesterday?! That is-- [in her head] Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check!  [out loud] Overall, it was... kinda, sorta... [quickly] Overall, it was  okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go! Apple Bloom: Do y'all think she liked it? Sweetie Belle: I'm not really sure. Scootaloo: You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies! Diamond Tiara: Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this. They could win! Silver Spoon: But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks! Diamond Tiara: Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin. Or maybe... get under their wings. Diamond Tiara: Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive! Sweetie Belle: Wait... What? Apple Bloom: Um... Thanks? Silver Spoon: Oh, but of course. As a matter of fact, we think you're very brave. Scootaloo: Brave? Why? Diamond Tiara: Isn't it obvious? It is to us. In fact,  it's obvious to everypony. You're showing all three <span style="background-color:yellow">types</span> of Ponyville  ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony... Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: ...who can't even fly! Apple Bloom: What in tarnation does that have to do with anything? Silver Spoon: I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything. Doesn't it? Diamond Tiara: I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago. Scootaloo: So what if my wings can't get me off the ground? Diamond Tiara: Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting off the ground either. Silver Spoon: Ms. Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front of all of Equestria. Sweetie Belle: Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that! Silver Spoon: I would've thought that was obvious. Diamond Tiara: Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will never—how shall I say—take off! Sweetie Belle: Don't listen to them, Scootaloo. Scootaloo? You okay? Scootaloo: This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing. Sweetie Belle: What? Apple Bloom: Why? Scootaloo: If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly! Sweetie Belle: Is that even possible? Apple Bloom: And by tomorrow? Scootaloo: Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard. Apple Bloom: Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem. Scootaloo: Well, I know this for sure – flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice! Sweetie Belle: Is this a good idea? Scootaloo: Whoaaaaa! [thud] Scootaloo: I'll just work four times as hard! Apple Bloom: Probably not. Scootaloo: [sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again! Apple Bloom: [yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired! Scootaloo: Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying  entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right,  and then there's the hoop. Then I come in-- [thud] Scootaloo: Not quite what I had in mind. We'll just... try that part again. [straining noises] Apple Bloom: [hushed] I liked the routine the way it was! Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Me too! But all she cares about now is flying! Scootaloo: Don't worry, I'll be flying high tomorrow on  our final run-through for Rainbow Dash. I'm gonna get this, you'll see.  [straining noises] [thud] Rainbow Dash: Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your  final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow. I know you're  gonna absolutely, positively-- have a lot of fun, heheh. Okay, go!  [blows whistle] Scootaloo: [panting] Ponyville! Home of the, um... Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Friendship! Scootaloo: Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four-- no, three kinds of ponies. Apple Bloom: [yawns] Sweetie Belle: [hushed] Left, left! Apple Bloom: [hushed] I'm sorry! I'm just tired! And then I dip, and then we turn, and-- Sorry! Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: [straining noises] [boing] [thud] Scootaloo: Ta-da! Oof! [panting] So? What'cha think? Rainbow Dash: That's... y'know... good and all, heheh...  I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the  first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better?  Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right?  Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't  forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See  you in the morning! Scootaloo: What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless... Sweetie Belle: I'm just too tired! I can't keep going! Apple Bloom: Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now! Sweetie Belle: She's right. It's like you don't even need us anymore! Scootaloo: Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop? Apple Bloom: Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep. Scootaloo: So? Are you gonna leave me too? Sweetie Belle: We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire. I'd better get some rest. See you in the morning, Scootaloo. Scootaloo: Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> times as hard! [straining noises] Thirty times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder! [thud] Scootaloo: [straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly. I just... can't. Train conductor: Crystal Empire! All aboard! Sweetie Belle: Scootaloo? Where is she? Apple Bloom: She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave! Scootaloo: Here I am... Apple Bloom: We were scared you were gonna miss the train! Scootaloo: I... I'm not going. Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: What?! Scootaloo: I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two. Sweetie Belle: I can't believe you're quitting on us! Scootaloo: But you're better off without me! Sweetie Belle: But that's not true, Scootaloo! Apple Bloom: You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't need her! Scootaloo: Fine! Apple Bloom: Fine! Sweetie Belle: Fine... Train conductor: All aboard! [train puffing] [train whistle blowing] Rainbow Dash: How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I  just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom,  bom, bom... and then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the  hoop! Apple Bloom: Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo. Sweetie Belle: She's staying home. Rainbow Dash: She's what?! Apple Bloom: She got it in her head that the only way to  represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do  it, she told us that she was quittin'. Rainbow Dash: And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right? Sweetie Belle: Well, actually, we kinda told her... Apple Bloom: ...uh, that we didn't want a quitter. Rainbow Dash: Hang on. Are you nuts?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind! [ding] [brakes squealing] Rainbow Dash: Come on! Diamond Tiara: Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle! Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [laughing, under] Sweetie Belle: I do not like them one bit. Rainbow Dash: Put on some speed, girls! [ripping noises] [clang] Rainbow Dash: Throwing away your scooter?! Scootaloo: Rainbow Dash? Rainbow Dash: Yup, but not just me. Scootaloo: I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train. Apple Bloom: We're not goin'. Sweetie Belle: Not without you, Scootaloo. Rainbow Dash: What's gotten into you, Scootaloo? Scootaloo: I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly. Rainbow Dash: And who said you had to? Scootaloo: But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games! Rainbow Dash: But that was me! You're you! And it just  doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it  represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You do still know what that is, right? Sweetie Belle: Friendship. Apple Bloom: Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies... Sweetie Belle: ...unicorns... Scootaloo: ...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly? Rainbow Dash: Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly  someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's  the toughest little pony in town? [Sweetie Belle] Got the moves, got the mojo... [Apple Bloom] No harder working pony around. [Scootaloo] We are a trio, work as a team [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene Scootaloo: So let's get to the Crystal Empire and let's do the routine as it was! And let's win this thing! [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle] We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses We've got hearts as strong as horses And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory We can conquer any challenge we're in We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses Hearts strong as horses [crowd cheering] Crusaders: Ponyville forever! Yay! [microphone feedback] Ms. Harshwhinny: [through microphone] In the Equestria Games, the Ponyville flag will be carried by... 'Cutie Mark Crusaders'! [crowd cheering] Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon: [groaning] Rainbow Dash: Ahem. Look. What you three did was... acceptable. Ms. Harshwhinny: Acceptable? Acceptable?! Why, it was totally stupendously the single most amazing thing I've ever seen! [laughs] Rainbow Dash: Contain your excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny. Remember – professionalism. Ms. Harshwhinny: Ahem. Y-Yes, well, I- [laughs nervously] Rainbow Dash and Crusaders: [laughing] Scootaloo: You know what this means, right? Apple Bloom: What? Scootaloo: We are totally gonna get cutie marks in flag-carrying! Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle: Yeah! Crusaders: [laughing] [credits]			<br>

			<a href="All Transcripts - My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki.html#VivaLasPegasus"><h3>Viva Las Pegasus</h3></a>Viva Las Pegasus Applejack: The map is sendin' us where?! Fluttershy: Las Pegasus?! Applejack: But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot! It's just one big party! Fluttershy: All those lights and sounds, not to mention the crowds... Oh, just the thought of it is overwhelming! Twilight Sparkle: I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem like  either of your cups of tea, but I have total faith you wouldn't have  been called unless you were the perfect ponies for the job. Applejack: Probably not as bad as we think. It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time... right? [pop] Fluttershy: Uh, Applejack? It isn't as bad as we thought. [crowds cheering] Applejack: You're right. It's worse! [theme song] Applejack and Fluttershy: [gasp] [general chatter] Fluttershy: Do you think the map could be on the fritz  again? I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even  Rainbow Dash. Applejack: If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I. All  we have to do is solve our friendship problem and get back home.  'Course, we have to find it first. Barker: And make sure to experience our signature show, Ponet Fantastique!  Trust me when I say you've never seen anything like it! Unparalleled  acrobatics! Unique animal antics! Your only regret will be that you  didn't see it sooner! And like everything at this amazing, incredible,  I-can't-believe-it-even-exists hotel, Ponet Fantastique is brought to you by the chairpony of kindness – Gladmane himself! [crowd gasping] Fluttershy: Wow. This Gladmane sure seems impressive. Gladmane: Well, uh, it is a little embarrassing, but the crowds seem to like it. Uh-huh-huh. Applejack: Mr. Gladmane? Gladmane: Just Gladmane'll do. And it's a pleasure to  meet actual cohorts of the Princess of Friendship! Thank you for coming.  Thank you very much. Fluttershy: You know who we are? Gladmane: I'm what you might call a friendship  connoisseur, so naturally I'm familiar with the friends of the great  Twilight Sparkle! Applejack, Fluttershy, it's an honor to have you here.  Uh-huh-huh. Applejack: I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus. Gladmane: [laughs] Well, my guests may be looking for  lights, music, and parties, but working hard and making friends is how I  turned this hotel into what it is today, and how I plan to make it even  bigger. Uh-huh-huh! Uh, excuse me for a second. [inhales] [through  loudspeaker] Wise ponies may say the folks that come here are  customers, but I can't help but thinkin' of each and every one of you as  friends. That's why there's a three-for-one special on apple fritters  in the cafe for the next hour! Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh! [crowd chattering] Gladmane: Would you two like to take a tour of the place? I'm just about to do my rounds and check on my friends who work here. Fluttershy: [hushed] We do have a friendship problem to find. Applejack: Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane! Gladmane: Just Gladmane now, you hear? Trapeze Star: [gasps] Gladmane, you're just in time to see my newest move! Gladmane: New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what. Trapeze Star: Oh, don't make me blush! Now watch this! Gladmane: Stellar! Uh-huh-huh! Director: Oh! Oh! Monsieur Gladmane himself is here! Let's run through the whole routine! Gladmane: Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me. I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack and Fluttershy. Applejack: Howdy! Fluttershy: Hi. Director: If zis pony calls you friend, you're welcome backstage anytime! I owe him my entire career. Gladmane: Aw, shucks. Well, let's leave the artists to their work. Applejack: [hushed] Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here. Fluttershy: [gasps] I've never seen a pink prairie dog before! [prairie dog squeaking] Gladmane: I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience. Uh-huh-huh. "Roar Horn": Und we love him for it! "Sprigfield": With Gladmane's help, we've been able to take care of all these little guys! Fluttershy: Now this place is overwhelming in a good way! Gladmane: Aw, glad you like it. Applejack: [clears throat] Fluttershy? Fluttershy: Hmm? Oh, um, coming! Fluttershy: There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all. Applejack: I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in  Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of  needles. But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine. Flim: Ladies and gentleponies, despite what my  competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be  entertained, and I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than  the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Ponet Fantastique! Flam: Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't  for the existence, and far superiorly entertaining presence, of the  show-stopping exotic animal act that Ponet Fantastique includes! Fluttershy: Those voices sound familiar. Applejack: They sure do. Flim and Flam. Flim: Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider offering them to you at a substantial discount! Flam: But I've always thought you get what you pay for, and in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price! Flim: Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride! Flam: [gasps] Charlatan? How dare you! Flim: Hah! How dare I?! Flam: [simultaneous] Yes, how dare you! I was the one that... Flim: [simultaneous] I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother of mine! Flam: [simultaneous, background] I'm two minutes older than you – don't you forget that, brother of mine! Flim: [simultaneous, background] I'm sick and tired of this... Flim and Flam: [further unintelligible arguing] Fluttershy: They certainly don't seem to be getting along. [gasps] You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them? Applejack: Absolutely not! Flim and Flam: [arguing] Fluttershy: I know you and the rest of the Apple family  have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're  definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is  important, no matter who's having it. Applejack: Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them! Gladmane: I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't know  why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here. I  thought giving them these jobs might help, but I... I guess it just made  matters worse. Applejack: Trust me. I know those ponies, and you're  better off with them apart. The two of them together will cheat the  hooves right out from under you! Gladmane: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a  showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did  work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking  of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you  hear? Fluttershy: I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam... Applejack: And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it! Fluttershy: [sighs] Flim: I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother. Flam: Brother? I don't believe I have one of those. Flim: No! I already know what he thinks of me! All show  and no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble  becoming a big success on his own! Flam: "Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, of course!" Just ask him. He'll tell you all about it. Fluttershy: I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other. Flim and Flam: I'm never speaking to that pony again! Fluttershy: [sighs] [general casino chatter and noises] Director: [muffled] No! [normal] You are ruining my show! Trapeze Star: It isn't just your show, and I'm improving it. Director: You don't pull a rabbit out of a hat on the trapeze! Trapeze Star: That's the point – to give the audience something they've never seen before! Acrobatic magic! [twirling] Bernard Rabbit: Ta-da! Trapeze Star: It's called "blending genres", and it's awesome! Applejack: Shouldn't somepony do somethin'? "Back Stage": Hah. They've been doing this since they  started working here. Too bad, really. If they ever stopped shouting at  each other, we could take the show on tour. They'd be way more successful than staying at Gladmane's. Applejack: Heh-heh. Now that sounds like a real friendship problem! "Roar Horn": Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! "Sprigfield": Stop! What are you doing?! It's supposed to be a pink prairie dog pyramid! It's alliterative! "Roar Horn": Wha— You said a tower! Why do you keep changing everything? [prairie dogs squeaking] "Sprigfield": I'm not changing anything! You said pyramid! "Roar Horn": [shrieks] You are driving me crazy! Applejack: I thought you two got along. "Sprigfield": We used to, but we just can't seem to  agree on anything anymore. We used to perform all over Equestria, but if  we can't agree on a new act, we might as well stay at Gladmane's  forever. [stomping] Applejack: Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'! Fluttershy: If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place! Applejack: Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem. Fluttershy: It certainly isn't for Gladmane. Sounds like he's better off with them fighting. Applejack: Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed  to be good for Gladmane too. Both the trapeze show and the animal act  would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that  they can't. Fluttershy: Do you think he knows? Applejack: I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out. Trapeze Star: Of course Gladmane wants everypony to get  along. He's the nicest, most genuine pony I've ever met. Did the  director put you up to this? Bernard Rabbit: [unintelligible whispering] Director: I tell you, if Gladmane is your friend, you are welcome backstage. But if you are speaking of him poorly, you leave! "Roar Horn": Gladmane is the kindest, most gentle... "Sprigfield": ...most compassionate pony I've ever known! "Roar Horn" and "Sprigfield": My problem... is with him! [prairie dogs squeaking] Applejack: I just can't figure it! The only pony who  benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's  the best friend any of these ponies have! Fluttershy: Well, Bernard – that adorable bunny from the  acrobat's act – claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director  that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the  star that the director wants to get rid of her! But neither is true! Applejack: [snorts] Fluttershy: And the Flying Prairinos – the pink prairie  dog family – say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer  think the other is doing it! Applejack: So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose! Fluttershy: But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing? Applejack: There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth! Fluttershy: Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>ter. Flim and Flam: [unintelligible arguing] Fluttershy: Or maybe a pair of ponies? Applejack: [sighs] Fine. Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here. Maybe. Flim: Sorry if I don't take the word of somepony off the street, even if that street is in Ponyville. Fluttershy: But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems. How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours? Flam: Because the only problem I have is standing right there. Flim: Same here, buster! Applejack: Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over? Flim: Gladmane let me know that ex-brother of mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea! Flam: Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks! Applejack: Sounds to me like neither of you said those things. Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did? Flim: Why would he lie? Fluttershy: Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort. Applejack: And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because— Flim and Flam: You never lie! Flam: Oh, brother of mine, I think it's time for a little payback! Flim: The Canterlot Two-Step? Flam: Mmm, we don't have the chickens. How about the Baltimare Flair? Flim: Ah, my flair isn't what it used to be. Gladmane: [over loudspeaker] Listen here, y'all! If  you're a friend of mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, and  everypony is a friend of mine! Thank you. Thank you very much. Flim: Are you thinking what I am? Flam: The High Roller Hustle! Applejack: The what now? Flam: Trust us. When we're done, there won't be a pony  in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That  is, assuming you two are willing to help. Flim: What size gown do you wear? [crowd chattering and cameras clicking] Gladmane: Wh-What's all the fuss, now? Flim: It's the grand matriarch of the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one of the wealthiest ponies in Equestria. Gladmane: Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch. Flim: Well, she's not exactly a guest. Word is she's  planning a resort of her own. [hushed] I think she's here to scout the  competition. Gladmane: [hushed] Oh, really? Flim: And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants! Gladmane: [growling] Flim: Uh, not me, of course! I love it here. My good-for-nothing brother, on the other hoof... Gladmane: [snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is  to have you at my humble <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an  excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized  tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh. Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: You'll have to excuse Ms. Rich. She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud and uses it to make more money. Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour? Gladmane: Well, that sounds right pleasant. And if you  can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my office so I  can get ready. [curtain rustling] Fluttershy: Are all of you sure this is a good idea? Flim: Abso-tively! Flam: Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good! Applejack: I sure hope you two know what you're doin'. Flam: Oho, don't you worry. When it comes to throwing ponies off their game... Flim: No two ponies do it better than us! Applejack: Can't argue with that. [door opens] Flam: Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour. So what did you want to see me about? Gladmane: Actually, there's something I want you to see – the Grand Plan. Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, and every one of 'em mine. Flam: [whistles] Gladmane: And all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this. [click] Gladmane: [over loudspeaker] Hey there, friends. Uh-huh-huh. If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Ponet Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now. Two for the price of one! Thank you. Thank you very much. [click] Gladmane: Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting offer to come work for her. Flam: Well uh, now that you mention it... Gladmane: And as your friend, I'd never tell you what to  do. But nopony's gonna stand in the way of my plans, no matter how rich  she is! And I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side.  Think you might consider staying here? Flam: Um... Gladmane: Well all right then. Applejack: They're comin'! Gladmane: And last but not least, Ms. Rich, the jewel in my crown. Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort of this caliber going for long. Gladmane: Oh? And why's that? Fluttershy: [unintelligible whispering] Flam: Because you've got the best talents in the industry. What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor? Gladmane: [laughs] Well, you see I have a trick for  that, I must confess. Uh-huh-huh. And it all has to do [also over  loudspeaker] with how I handle my employees. Flam: And how is that? Gladmane: [also over loudspeaker] Well, like friends, of course! And I treat every one of my employees with the kindness they deserve. Flam: [stammering] That's it? That's your secret, heh-heh? There's... [clears throat] ...nothing else? Gladmane: Nope, just friendship. But you know all about friendship, don't you... Fluttershy?! Flim: You knew the whole time? Gladmane: Never try to con a con-pony. Uh-huh-huh. [laughs] Yeah! [bits jingling] [door opens] Gladmane: I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now. Fluttershy: Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just... mean! Gladmane: Now, maybe it is. But it's a meanness that  works. Unlike your pathetic little ploy. I practically invented the  "High Roller Hustle". But I suppose I should be impressed. You're the  only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of  work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced  that I'm their only friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead. Applejack: Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession! Gladmane: Oh, no. No, no, w-w-wait, wait! Fluttershy: [over loudspeaker] Did that sound okay? Flim and Flam: Never better! Applejack: [over loudspeaker] Flim and Flam told us  you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did,  you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part of  the plan! Gladmane: Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything! Director: I think you've done enough of that! Darling? Trapeze Star: Hmph! "Roar Horn": Oh, I cannot believe we let him almost ruin our friendship! "Sprigfield": And our act. Good luck finding another one! Gladmane: Wait! No! Y'all come back! Come on, I-I'm  gonna be ruined! This is Gladmane's, y'all! Come on, you can't do this  to... [wailing trails off] Applejack: Gladmane has left the buildin'! [crunching, crash] Fluttershy: I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all. [cutie marks ringing] Fluttershy: If it weren't for your history with Flim and  Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to  help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing. Applejack: And if it weren't for you wantin' to  show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able  to trick the <span style="background-color:yellow">tricks</span>ter. [to Flim and Flam] Must've felt pretty nice to  finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use. Flam: In fact, we might think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Flim: Emphasis on "once". Fluttershy: [suspiciously] What do you mean? Flam: [over loudspeaker] While this establishment  undergoes a slight change in management, my brother and I want to assure  you that it remains the pinnacle of Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is  why we invite each and every one of you to experience the wonder of the  Ponet Fantastique Theater – at half the normal cost of admission! Flim: [over loudspeaker] And while you're  appreciating this historic venue totally devoid of any performers of any  kind, we invite you to use the wonder of your own imaginations to fill  the space at no additional charge! [crowd excited chattering] Applejack: Flim and Flam! [credits]			<br>

[thud!] Spike: Twilight, mail's here! [doors opening] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] [squeak] Twilight Sparkle: Are you all right? Derpy: We just had a really heavy delivery today. Spike: Is it a deluxe set of special edition Ogres & Oubliettes figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever? Derpy: Well, it's for Twilight. Spike: Awww... Twilight Sparkle: Thank you. Derpy: You're welcome! Twilight Sparkle: Huh. It's from Princess Celestia. Spike: [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box? Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have  been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a  few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them  back." I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this?  It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a  filly! Spike: [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that? Twilight Sparkle: My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls! And here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true! Spike: Is my Smash Fortune comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa! [thud] Spike: [muffled] Or this. Twilight Sparkle: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Spike: What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book. Twilight Sparkle: Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue! [theme song] Twilight Sparkle: You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record! Spike: [clears throat] Had a perfect record. Twilight Sparkle: [groans] I've never turned in a book even a minute late! And this one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville! [stamping] Dusty Pages: Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it. Twilight Sparkle: I promise I won't let you down! Dusty Pages: Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's  anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle.  After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title. Twilight Sparkle: Oooh! I hope I do forever! Twilight Sparkle: Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for? Spike: Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but... Twilight Sparkle: Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing. Twilight Sparkle: And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville,  and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books  were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself! Spike: I take it we're going to Canterlot? [zip!] Spike: [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess. Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] [leaves rustling] Spike: Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book? Twilight Sparkle: Yes. But what if somepony sees me in  there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize  me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof. Spike: [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses! Twilight Sparkle: A late book is a big deal, Spike. What  if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering  the building again?! Spike: Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home? Twilight Sparkle: Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell! Spike: You sniff books? Twilight Sparkle: You don't? I used to live in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess am I? Spike: One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better. Twilight Sparkle: Thanks, Spike. Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously] Spike: [groans] [teleportation zaps] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return. Librarian Pony: Princess Twilight! So good to see you! Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Librarian Pony: Need some recommendations from the new release section? Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's Seven Theories on Bending Time? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks! [ponies gasp] Twilight Sparkle: But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter. Librarian Pony: Dusty who? Twilight Sparkle: [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever. Librarian Pony: I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower? Twilight Sparkle: [nervous giggle] Spike: [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time! Twilight Sparkle: [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs]  Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out  this long will probably cost a thousand bits! Spike: She— I mean, we have an overdue book. Librarian Pony: [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time. Spike: See? Librarian Pony: I'll just find it in the card catalog.  Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I  haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need  to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for  Ponies Who Should Know Better. Twilight Sparkle: Don't pull any punches with those names, do you? Spike: And that office would be...? Librarian Pony: In the basement. [whispering] Because of the shame. [thud] Spike: Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here. Twilight Sparkle: Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds! Spike: And faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door! Twilight Sparkle: "Abandon hope, all ye who enter"? Spike: [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row." Guess we'll have to try back later! Twilight Sparkle: No! I can't wait another minute to  return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up  another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch! Spike: Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips] [beat] Spike: Oh. You mean to find First Folio. Can we at least get takeout?! Twilight Sparkle: Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies. Spike: Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already! Twilight Sparkle: And my late fines are already up another <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>-six more bits! Spike: [mock-sobbing] Pretzel: Waiter, we're ready to order. Spike: Oh, uh, I'm not actually— Pretzel: Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us? Spike: Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table? Pretzel: Sounds great. Moon Dancer: Twilight? Is that you? Twilight Sparkle: Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh. Moon Dancer: Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us? Twilight Sparkle: First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you. First Folio: Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower? Twilight Sparkle: Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that. Moon Dancer: Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know? Twilight Sparkle: Mm-mm. First Folio: Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library. Twilight Sparkle: Wait. Forced to leave? First Folio: Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all. Moon Dancer: Are you okay, Twilight? Twilight Sparkle: [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me? [whoosh] [spinning] Spike: That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong? Twilight Sparkle: Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because I didn't return this book! Spike, I think I got her fired! [brake skids] Spike: Twilight, the library is that way! Twilight Sparkle: Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time. Spike: But what about your late fees? Twilight Sparkle: They're not as important as making things right. Spike: Wait. So you're not going to return the book? Twilight Sparkle: No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she  lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back.  It'll fix everything! [sighs] [knocking] [door opens] Meathead Pony: Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies! Twilight Sparkle: Oh, I'm not selling anything. Meathead Pony: No carolers either. No surveys, no petitions, no free literature... [thud] Twilight Sparkle: No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house. Meathead Pony: Dusty Pages? Twilight Sparkle: Yes! Meathead Pony: Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this. [thud] Meathead Pony: It's been stackin' up for years! And tell her to change her address! [door slams] [montage music] [knocking] [squeaking] Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "Silver Stable Community: For the best golden years." This has to be it! Spike: I hope so. It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked. [door opens] Spike: [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is— Twilight Sparkle: Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight! Sand Trap: [snoring] Twilight Sparkle: Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me! "Teddie Safari": Yes, how may I help you? Twilight Sparkle: Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages? "Teddie Safari": Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor. Twilight Sparkle: Thank you! Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe that my carelessness sent her here, when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books! Spike: You realize that might just be a you thing, right? Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales] [knocking] [long pause] [watch ticking] Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Spike: She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here. Twilight Sparkle: No. We are fixing this now. This place isn't that big. We can find her. Twilight Sparkle: Sorry to interrupt your plein air painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her? Apple Rose: Sure have! [beat] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] And...? Apple Rose: She had to leave early to get to her fengbi de ti session. Old Stallion: Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing. Apple Rose: Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again. Old Stallion: Then there's her band practice later. Twilight Sparkle: Thank you! Spike: Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony. Twilight Sparkle: Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long! [montage music] [gate swinging] [teleportation zap] [hammer tapping] [door shuts and opens] [splash] [more splashes] [door opens] [door opens] [band playing music] Twilight Sparkle: Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike! Spike: Wait. She looks pretty happy up there. Twilight Sparkle: Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library! [music abruptly stops] Twilight Sparkle: Care to take <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>, everypony? Dusty Pages: Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here? Twilight Sparkle: I've been looking all over Equestria for you! [thud] Twilight Sparkle: I need to tell you something. Dusty Pages: Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles] Twilight Sparkle: No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right. Dusty Pages: I don't remember you doing anything wrong. Twilight Sparkle: You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back! Dusty Pages: [gasps] It was you that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record? Twilight Sparkle: But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back! Dusty Pages: No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be. [band playing music] Spike: [snapping fingers] Twilight Sparkle: Do you mind? [music pauses, continues softly] Spike: [slurping] Twilight Sparkle: I don't understand. If Dusty Pages  won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she  won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain  imperfect! Spike: And yours will, too? Twilight Sparkle: Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more! Spike: [dryly] Really? Twilight Sparkle: Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?! [abacus clicking] Spike: Uhhh... you don't wanna know. Twilight Sparkle: [groans] It would've been worth all  the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I  knew why she won't go back! Spike: Why don't you ask her? Twilight Sparkle: She didn't seem to want to talk. Spike: You surprised her, and she probably had something  else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got  to lose? Twilight Sparkle: Now that I've messed up this much?  Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she  went? Crochet? Bingo? [splat] Twilight Sparkle: A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?! [splats] Spike: Hey, everypony! We come in— [splat] Spike: Eh, pieces. [splats] [teleportation zap] [splats] Twilight Sparkle: Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please? Dusty Pages: Time out! [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear. Spike: We're not actually here for the game. Twilight Sparkle: I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book. Dusty Pages: [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it? Twilight Sparkle: Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by  not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it  up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if  that's what it takes. [ponies gasp] Dusty Pages: [laughs] Spike: That is not the reaction we expected. Dusty Pages: Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you! Twilight Sparkle: You're not? Dusty Pages: No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me. [tapping] Dusty Pages: All those years I spent hiding away in that  library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt  something exhilarating! Twilight Sparkle: What was it? Dusty Pages: Freedom. Spike: From books? Dusty Pages: From perfection! I was too stubborn to know  when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I  wasn't living the life I wanted! Twilight Sparkle: You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you wanted to? Dusty Pages: Twilight, your late book was the best thing  that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail  at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it  right! Twilight Sparkle: You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back? [splat] Twilight Sparkle: [strangled scream] Dusty Pages: Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words. Twilight Sparkle: But it'll have a stain! Dusty Pages: That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing? Twilight Sparkle: Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't. [splat] Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "Perfection". Dusty Pages: And the next part? Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit". Spike and Dusty Pages: [laughing] Twilight Sparkle: Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier. First Folio: Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to... Twilight Sparkle: However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan? First Folio: <span style="background-color:yellow">Twenty</span>-eight bits. Twilight Sparkle and Spike: [gasps] Spike: That's it?! First Folio: Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts] [bits clinking] First Folio: Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture. Twilight Sparkle: Um, is that really necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all. Spike: [clears throat] Twilight Sparkle: Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you? First Folio: No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy. Spike: In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around. First Folio: You sure? It's got a stain. Twilight Sparkle: That's what makes it perfect. [credits]			<br>

[whooshing] Silverstream: Whoa! Rainbow Dash: Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement? Applejack: You're just in time. But it's gonna be me. Rainbow Dash: Yeah, right. I got this one nailed. Twilight Sparkle: And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy! Applejack: [groans] Again? Rainbow Dash: Come on! Fluttershy: Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning. [camera flashes] Rainbow Dash: Yeah. Me, neither. Twilight Sparkle: The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you. [beat] Twilight Sparkle: Congratulations, Fluttershy! Fluttershy: [giggles] Twilight Sparkle: Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike? [pages flapping] Twilight Sparkle: Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two  states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section  two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning.  Add that together, and what do you get? Pinkie Pie: Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-<span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven? Twilight Sparkle: Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask— Applejack: I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together. Rainbow Dash: Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork. Applejack: [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me. Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better". Just a little more qualified. No offense. Fluttershy: Maybe you can lead the field trip together. Applejack: [stutters] Rainbow Dash: [stutters] Twilight Sparkle: Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team? Pinkie Pie: Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot? Twilight Sparkle: Both of you are teamwork experts. If  the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even  more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd  never let that get in the way of friendship education. Applejack: Of course! Rainbow Dash: Totally! Applejack and Rainbow Dash: [groans, chuckles] [theme song] Ocellus: I've never been on a field trip before. Smolder: Yeah, what's the point of this exactly? Gallus: Getting out of the classroom. Duh. Yona: Yak best at field-tripping! [grunts] Silverstream: That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts] Sandbar: [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind. Twilight Sparkle: All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship. Applejack: Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way? Rainbow Dash: This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa! Applejack: [chuckles nervously] With us in charge. Meanin' mostly me. Rainbow Dash: Yeah. Good one. Twilight Sparkle: And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today? Applejack: Shed buildin'!   Rainbow Dash: Canoe racing! Silverstream: No... way. We get to do both?! Twilight Sparkle: I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first? Applejack: Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader! Twilight Sparkle: I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together! Applejack: [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell? Gallus: [inhale] Uh, yak? Yona: [sniffing] Mm-hmm! Applejack: Nope. Try again. Ocellus: Um, apples? Applejack: And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of...  teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna  use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard  work and honest sweat. Rainbow Dash: [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship? Applejack: Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies. Rainbow Dash: Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity. [montage music] [hammering] [sawing] Applejack: That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady! Rainbow Dash: Emphasis on the slow. [whoosh] [thudding] Rainbow Dash: [grunting] Applejack: Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that! Rainbow Dash: [scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did! [thud] Sandbar: Whoa! No way! Rest of Young Six: Whoa! Gallus: Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive. Applejack: Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good! Rainbow Dash: Oh, sorry, can't hear you. Too busy practicing my "Teacher of the Month" pose. [grunting] Applejack: Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash. Rainbow Dash: Oh, come on! These students are totally gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done! Applejack: No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done right! Smolder: Yeah... This isn't awkward at all... [montage music continues] [wood creaking] [hammering] Applejack: Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow... [creaking] Applejack: Little to the left... [creaking] Applejack: Uh, a hair to the right... [creaking] Applejack: Now, a hoof shavin' higher... [creaking] Rainbow Dash: [growls] Just bring it down already! Gallus and Smolder: [yelps] Applejack: [yelps] [crash] Rainbow Dash: [chuckles nervously] Applejack: I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'. Yona: Yak side! [grunts] [thud] Yona: [chuckles nervously] Uh... Applejack: [sighs] Ocellus: Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now. Rainbow Dash: That's because you need a <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed! Applejack: [growls] Rainbow Dash: Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?! [cricket chirping] Gallus: Is that even a thing? Sandbar: First I've heard of it. Rainbow Dash: We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions? Yona: Uh, Yona has questions. Rainbow Dash: No time for 'em! Get in the boat! Applejack: You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy? Rainbow Dash: I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood. [splashing] Yona: Yak not like water. Ocellus: Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle. Yona: [weak whistling] Gallus: We got you, Yona. Yona: [yelping] [thud] Applejack: Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer. Rainbow Dash: We'll see about that. Rainbow Dash: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies! Applejack: Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all. Silverstream: Woo-hoo! We're really going now! Smolder: So... when do we get to the part when we move? [water splashing] Rainbow Dash: When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack! Now stroke! [water splashing] [water rushing] [watch ticking] Rainbow Dash: Dig in, team! We can still beat that record! Applejack: Stop! Rainbow Dash: Go! Ocellus: Which way do we go? Rainbow Dash: Left! Applejack: Right! Silverstream: Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what? Rainbow Dash: Left! I can see the finish line from here! Applejack: If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish! Rainbow Dash: Who cares about a few fish? Sandbar: Uh, professors? Applejack: You'll care plenty when they bite ya! Sandbar: Guys? Rainbow Dash: We'll just go around them! Sandbar: Rock! All: [screaming] [crash!] [water rushing] All: [gasping, coughing] Silverstream: [giggling] Yona: [panicked whistling] Oof! [grunting] [rip!] Silverstream: I love field trips! Applejack: I hope you're happy. Rainbow Dash: [scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record! Yona: [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim! [transformation zap] Ocellus: That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do! Yona: [panicked whistling, coughing] Twilight Sparkle: How's the canoeing... going? Smolder: About as good as the apple shed building. Rainbow Dash: I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up! Applejack: I did not! Rainbow Dash: Did too! Applejack: Did not! Gallus: Yup. It's been like this all day. Sandbar: I wouldn't say all day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it. Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that! Rainbow Dash: We are! Mostly. Applejack: We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all. Twilight Sparkle: The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care  about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be  thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field  trip! Applejack: H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash  for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to  build a shed. Rainbow Dash: No way! You're the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish. [beat] Rainbow Dash: Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month. Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all. Applejack: Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the— [muffled] Rainbow Dash: Field trip? Twilight Sparkle: Well... Rainbow Dash: Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack? Applejack: Right as rain and twice as fresh! [hoof-bump] Twilight Sparkle: Fine. But I'm picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right? Applejack and Rainbow Dash: Right! Applejack: See? We're agreein' already. Applejack: Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right? Smolder: Ugh. Here we go again. Applejack: Where to, Rainbow Dash? Rainbow Dash: I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes you happy makes me happy. Applejack: Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right. Rainbow Dash: But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you. Applejack: Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to you. Yona: Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way! Applejack: Hey! Where are y'all goin'? [montage music] Ocellus: I think we've gone in the same circle <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> times. Sandbar: Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go. Rainbow Dash: Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack? Applejack: Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist. Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] No, no. I insist. Applejack: Heh. But I insisted first. Silverstream: Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost. Smolder: Ugh. [whoosh] Smolder: We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back. Rainbow Dash: We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack? Applejack: Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a  bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is,  if-if you think a bridge is a good idea. Rainbow Dash: Only if you want to build a bridge. Gallus: Stop! Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done. Applejack: Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork. Rainbow Dash: Cooperation! Applejack: Togetherness! Rainbow Dash: You are so right! Applejack: Only as right as you are! Smolder: Okay! We'll build a bridge! What do we use? Applejack: Branches!   Rainbow Dash: Vines! [beat] Applejack: Vines!   Rainbow Dash: Branches! Applejack: I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it! Rainbow Dash: I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End of story! [montage music] Ocellus: [yawns] [crickets chirping] Applejack: [muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa! Young Six: [gasps] Applejack: [grunting] Young Six: [sighs] [crack] Rainbow Dash: Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so— [yelping] ...easy to work with. Young Six: [gasps] [wind whistling] Applejack: [muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash: Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to— [screams] Applejack: [screams] Applejack and Rainbow Dash: [screaming] Help! Ocellus: Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something. [vines creaking] Rainbow Dash: [grunting] I can't get out! Applejack: Let me try. [grunting] [vines creaking] [teeth snapping] Rainbow Dash: Let me guess. Bite-acudas? [splashing] Applejack: Mm-hmm. [teeth snapping] Applejack: And they look mighty hungry. Sandbar: We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan? Gallus: Leave 'em hangin'? Silverstream: What?! Gallus: I'm kidding! ...Kinda. Ocellus: We need to work fast! And together! [vines snapping] Smolder: But mainly fast. Applejack: I hate to admit it, but— [vines snapping] Applejack: ...this whole mess is kinda our fault. Rainbow Dash: Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over. Applejack: So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel? Rainbow Dash: I thought you'd never ask. Rainbow Dash and Applejack: [screams] Ocellus: Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction. Rainbow Dash: Ocellus?! Applejack: [sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us! [splashing] Ocellus: [roars, chomp-chomp] [splashing] [vines snapping] Rainbow Dash and Applejack: [screaming] Silverstream: Need a lift? Yona: Yak smash! [grunting] Sandbar: [grunting] Smolder: [grunting] Yona: [laughing, grunting] Sandbar: Welcome back, professors! Rainbow Dash: Now, that was a rescue! Applejack: And y'all did it together! Young Six: [cheering] Gallus: No big. Those fish weren't even a thing. Ocellus: [growls] Gallus: [screams] Ocellus: [chuckles] Oops. Sorry. Silverstream: [giggles] Best... field trip... ever! [door opens] Twilight Sparkle: Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn? Rainbow Dash and Applejack: Uhhhh... Yona: Yak learn ponies smart! Silverstream: Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers! Gallus: It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do. Twilight Sparkle: Really...? Sandbar: It took us a while to get it. Smolder: Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home. Silverstream: But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is. Gallus: Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment. Ocellus: We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack. Twilight Sparkle: Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad  to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule  another one right away. Young Six: [cheering] Twilight Sparkle: [to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you? Applejack: To tell you the truth... yeah. Rainbow Dash: Well, not all the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk. Applejack: Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award! Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Rainbow Dash: You were the one doing the "angling"! Applejack: [scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'! Rainbow Dash: What does that even mean?! No one here can understand your country bumpkin talk...!   Applejack: Look, we all live in the same town here...! [credits]			<br>

			<a href="All Transcripts - My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki.html#NoSecondPrances"><h3>No Second Prances</h3></a>No Second Prances [wheels squeaking] [light thud] Twilight Sparkle: First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table without using magic, so that— Yikes! [silverware clattering] Twilight Sparkle: Did you...?! How? When? What?! Starlight Glimmer: What? Twilight Sparkle: I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson. Starlight Glimmer: Oh, I heard "set the table" and just kinda went for it. Twilight Sparkle: Well, if you hadn't used magic,  you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this  spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with  knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually  setting the table. Starlight Glimmer: Should I... change it back? Twilight Sparkle: I just want to make sure you're ready  for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to  see how the friendship lessons are going! Starlight Glimmer: If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there four seats? Twilight Sparkle: Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. And how good a teacher you have. Starlight Glimmer: Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends. Twilight Sparkle: That's the best part! You have to make a new friend! Starlight Glimmer: New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville! Twilight Sparkle: Starlight! Starlight Glimmer: Kidding! [laughs nervously] [theme song] Starlight Glimmer: Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard... Pinkie Pie: Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you! Pinkie Pie: Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs. Cake! [small splats] Mrs. Cake: How are you, dearie? Starlight Glimmer: Are you baking? Can I help? [magic whirls] Pinkie Pie: Wow, Mrs. Cake! Look what your new friend made you! Mrs. Cake: [chuckles] New friend. I like the sound of– [gasps] Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?! [splat] Mrs. Cake: [yelps and spits] Starlight Glimmer: Sorry... Pinkie Pie: [licks, swallows] In her defense, it is delicious! [chomps] [thump] [apples falling] Applejack: I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac! Big McIntosh: Eeyup! Applejack: He's not much of a talker. Big McIntosh: Nnope. Starlight Glimmer: Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation. [magic wisps] Big McIntosh: [motormouth]  Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa!  What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! And I'm so  articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! Annie Apple awoke and accidentally ate an auburn azalea! [screams] Make it stop! Applejack: [growls] Starlight Glimmer: I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk. Applejack: [growls] Starlight Glimmer: ...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to? Applejack: [growls] Starlight Glimmer: Alright, I'll change him back! Rarity: The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know. Starlight Glimmer: I'm glad you all got past my first impression. Rarity: Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh!  Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here  with a crinoline underneath. Starlight Glimmer: You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies? Rarity: Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling! Starlight Glimmer: When will it be ready? Rarity: Three weeks. Starlight Glimmer: Dinner's tomorrow. Rarity: Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin? [fabric ripping] Starlight Glimmer: Ugh! Maybe not. Rainbow Dash: Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness. Starlight Glimmer: Like you? Rainbow Dash: Yeah, but you already know me, so... [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh. Sorry. Starlight Glimmer: Who's that? Rainbow Dash: [gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you! [sonic boom] Rainbow Dash: You coming or what? Starlight Glimmer: I guess my first question would be, "What's a Wonderbolt?" Rainbow Dash: [gasps] You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?! Starlight Glimmer: [nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess... Rainbow Dash: Right. Angel: [giggling] Starlight Glimmer: You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind. Fluttershy: [sighs] [ponies chattering] Starlight Glimmer: [groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with me! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase. [more ponies chattering] Starlight Glimmer: [to herself] Stop stressing... Stop stressing! [long beat] [door opens and shuts] Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] This is just what I needed. Trixie: [sighs] Tell me about it. Starlight Glimmer: You ever have one of those days? Trixie: For me, they're all one of those days. Starlight Glimmer: [giggles] Trixie: I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville. Starlight Glimmer: I'm not from here either. I've been  trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I  think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit...  completely and utterly evil? Trixie: Ponies judge me on my past too. Starlight Glimmer: Finally, a pony I can relate to. Twilight Sparkle: Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon,  strawberry pick. I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the  greatest magic of all is proper silverware placement! [giggles] Starlight Glimmer: Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend! Twilight Sparkle: That's fantastic news! Starlight Glimmer: She's great! Twilight Sparkle: Great! Starlight Glimmer: She's powerful! Twilight Sparkle: Powerful? Starlight Glimmer: She's— Trixie: Hello... princess! Twilight Sparkle: Trixie?! Starlight Glimmer: You know each other? Twilight Sparkle: You could say that. Trixie: We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it. [pause] Twilight Sparkle: So, um, what brings you to Ponyville? Trixie: The Grrrreat and Powerful Trrrrixie  has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it  "The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour"! Starlight Glimmer: [hushed] That's kind of a mouthful. Trixie: [hushed] It's a working title. Twilight Sparkle: Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend. Starlight Glimmer: But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right? Twilight Sparkle: Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony. Starlight Glimmer: Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you. Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner. Starlight Glimmer: Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it! Twilight Sparkle: I hope not. [sighs] Trixie: This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen! Cherry Berry and Goldengrape: [unintelligible whispering] ...did you see...? Caramel, Shoeshine, and Sunshower Raindrops: [unintelligible whispering] ...did you hear...? Trixie: Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget. Starlight Glimmer: That's what I'm worried about. Trixie: [sighs] Starlight Glimmer: What is it? Trixie: I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends. Starlight Glimmer: Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel! Trixie: Can you keep a secret? Starlight Glimmer: What are friends for? Trixie: [hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at everything, and I wanted to beat her at something! Starlight Glimmer: [hushed] Your secret's safe with me. Trixie: Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon? Trixie: I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy. Starlight Glimmer: Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds... Starlight Glimmer and Trixie: [laughing] Twilight Sparkle: Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh! Starlight Glimmer: Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof. Trixie: Sure. The wagon's right around the corner. Twilight Sparkle: [hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend? Starlight Glimmer: [sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way. Twilight Sparkle: Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here. [bush rustling] Starlight Glimmer: [deadpan] Nice to meet you. Twilight Sparkle: No, no! You can come out now! [dubstep playing] Twilight Sparkle: You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be  the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with  Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh. Starlight Glimmer: So back at your castle when you said "I trust you", you meant "I don't trust you". Twilight Sparkle: [nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you? [dubstep fades out] Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you. Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection. Twilight Sparkle: That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her? [thump] Starlight Glimmer: Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony. Twilight Sparkle: But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that? Starlight Glimmer: Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me. Cranky Doodle Donkey: [snorts] [bird flapping] Twilight Sparkle: Oh! Now he'd be perfect! Starlight Glimmer: [groans] [thump] [dragging] Starlight Glimmer: I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic. Trixie: Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it. Starlight Glimmer: I meant stage magic. Trixie: Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the best. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do – the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive! [silent film-type piano music and film reel flickering] Trixie: [narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it  off – my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the  open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and  swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the  stage! [film reel runs out] Trixie: Completely unharmed! Starlight Glimmer: That sounds very... Trixie: Dangerous? Starlight Glimmer: I was gonna say cool! Trixie: I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore. Starlight Glimmer: Not if you could use real magic. Trixie: Obviously. Way to rub it in. Starlight Glimmer: No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you... [magic zap] Starlight Glimmer: ...and make you appear in the black box! Trixie: I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner. Starlight Glimmer: Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony! Trixie: We call it "assistant" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before. Starlight Glimmer: Well, I'd be honored. Trixie: You may have just made my great and powerful  magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna  blow them away tonight! Starlight Glimmer: [groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight. Trixie: Oh. Starlight Glimmer: Can I vent for a minute? Trixie: What are friends for? Starlight Glimmer: Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances. Trixie: Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight. If you have  to go to the dinner, I completely understand. [dramatically] I just  hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without  my new assistant! [ice sculpture dripping] Twilight Sparkle: Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh,  any minute, heh. Any minute now... [nervous laugh] [forced] How about I  introduce everyone? Our friendship lessons are going so well! She made  three new friends! She has such great taste in friends. I don't know  where she would've learned that! [nervous laugh] Cranky Doodle Donkey: Starlight Glimmer? I thought you said "nosehair trimmers"! What's going on? I'm hungry! And my nose is too hairy. [snorts] Twilight Sparkle: [nervously] Ha-ha, Cranky Doodle!  You're so funny! If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna check the kitchen. Maybe  she got lost amongst the, uh... artichokes! [nervous laugh] Twilight Sparkle: Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie. Pinkie Pie: So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour? Applejack: Ain't that a mouthful of molasses. Trixie: It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. Our lives. Starlight Glimmer: [sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner. Twilight Sparkle: Ahem? You just decided to skip our  dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment,  Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite  silverware placement?! Starlight Glimmer: Yes, but— Twilight Sparkle: This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie. Trixie: A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess?  It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not.  Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil  chose me, so ha! I win! Starlight Glimmer: You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight. Trixie: Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught  up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps]  Saying that didn't help, did it? Starlight Glimmer: I should've known. Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend. Why would you? [controlled sobbing] Trixie: Wait, it's not like that! I am your friend. [groans] Twilight Sparkle: Well, you won. I hope you're happy! Trixie: [sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show. Twilight Sparkle: Trixie? Trixie: ...Which is exactly the way she likes it!  Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who  wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't  feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces! [spotlight clanks] Trixie: [unenthusiastic] Come one, come all. Come and  see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's  "Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour". [crowd confused] Trixie: It's a working title! [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore. [manticore roars] Fluttershy: [trembling] Trixie: [unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive. [crowd gasps] Trixie: [unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for  when I defy the beast's jaws of doom and appear inside that black box.  [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and  powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend! Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, when I first came to  Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and  my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have  tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to  make your own decisions and your own friends. Starlight Glimmer: But... what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you? Twilight Sparkle: From what I've seen, she's the real thing. [fuse lights] Twilight Sparkle: But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you. [manticore roars] [fuse hisses] Trixie: Starlight? If you're out there and you still  want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together! [slightly  echoing] Please? [cannon fires] [manticore roars] Trixie: [shrieks] [manticore swallows and belches] [crowd gasps] Fluttershy: [faints] [crowd confused] [magic zap] [crunch] Trixie: [woozy] Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...! [thud] [beat] [crowd cheers] Trixie: [amplified] And now, I'm proud to introduce my  great and powerful assistant! [normal] And best friend. [amplified]  Starlight Glimmer! [crowd cheers] Twilight Sparkle: Trixie! Trixie: What do you want? Twilight Sparkle: I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that. Trixie: Thank you, princess. [fireworks launch] [ice sculpture dripping] Cranky Doodle Donkey: How do you get your hair to do that all the time? Princess Celestia: [sighs] [silent film-type piano music over credits]			<br>

			<a href="All Transcripts - My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki.html#Hearthbreakers"><h3>Hearthbreakers</h3></a>Hearthbreakers [rustling] Pinkie Pie: Happy Hearth's Warming Eve! [thud] Twilight Sparkle and Spike: [laughing] Applejack: Shucks, Twilight! Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here. Twilight Sparkle: We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us. Applejack: Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go. Twilight Sparkle: I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together. Pinkie Pie: Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of. Now multiply that times infinity! Whoo! It's gonna be great! [train whistle blowing] Applejack: That's us. See you later! Spike: Now can we open presents? Applejack: But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve. Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow. Twilight Sparkle: When Spike and I spent our first  Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his  presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before! Spike: It's kinda like our tradition! Applejack: That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it. Is it? Pinkie Pie: No sirree! Twilight Sparkle: To each their own, I suppose. [train whistle blowing] Pinkie Pie: Agh! Gotta go, bye! Spike: [straining] [paper tearing] Spike: Just what I always wanted! A book... [theme song] [train engine noises] Porter Pony: Chancellor Puddinghead puddings! How 'bout a Windigo-frosted snow cone? Applejack: It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof! Pinkie Pie: Apples and Pies together again for the first  time! Maybe. Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not. I think I  just confused myself. Applejack: Friends or family, this here's about togetherness. Apple Bloom: [mouth full] Have you tried the Equestria  flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! And don't tell Granny I saw, but her  trunk is full of presents! Applejack: Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right? Apple Bloom: Uh-oh. That's your boring sisterly lecture voice. Granny Smith: [snoring in background] Applejack: 'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends. Pinkie Pie: [as unicorn pony] I don't like you! [as Pegasus pony] I don't like you either! Applejack: But then, the icy chill of the Windigos  almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and  their friendship drove them nasty critters away. Pinkie Pie: [as Pegasus pony] Beat it, Windigos! Applejack: Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born. [biting sound] Applejack: Uh, what happened to the flag? Pinkie Pie: [chewing, with mouth full] I don't know... [swallows, licks] Apple Bloom: Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow? Applejack: Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors. Pinkie Pie: We do that too! Applejack: Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night. Pinkie Pie: That's what our family does too! Applejack: And tomorrow, we open presents! Pinkie Pie: Ah! We do that too! Apple Bloom: Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way! Applejack and Pinkie Pie: [simultaneously] Of  course! We might be related! Hey, I was gonna say that! Stop sayin' what  I'm sayin'! You stop it first! [beat] [laughing] [train whistle blows] [train braking] [train whistle blows] Pinkie Pie: I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am. What about... "rooftastic"? [squee] Applejack: "Rooftastic"? Pinkie Pie: As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is! [thump] Applejack: What if our families don't like each other? Pinkie Pie: We are friends, Applejack, and after  tonight, our families are gonna be friends too. Do you know what that  means? Number of Apples times number of Pies is <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> four, minus my  preexisting friendships plus one for Maud and you makes <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> from <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>  four is... [deep breath] nineteen new friendships! Maud! [squeals] Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack. I hope you had fun sledding yesterday. Applejack: How'd you know that? Maud Pie: [deadpan] Isn't it obvious? There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof. It's a mountain rock. Granny Smith: [hushed] Oh, she's good. Pinkie Pie: How's school going? Maud Pie: [deadpan] If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum. Pinkie Pie: I missed you so much! Apple family: Mm-hmm. Applejack: This place looks amazin'! Pinkie Pie: Come on, everypony! Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family! Everypony, meet everypony! Igneous Rock: Surely thy name is not but Granny Smith. I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie. Cloudy Quartz: Thou shalt know me as Cloudy Quartz. Igneous Rock: May Providence favor thee well, and to thou comfort our humble homestead bring. Granny Smith: Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like.  Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were? "Iggy"? And I'm just gonna call  you "Big Mama Q"! Limestone Pie: Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie. Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running. Cross me and— Pinkie Pie: Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine! Limestone Pie: Or Holder's Boulder! Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder. There, you happy now? Applejack: And you must be— Pinkie Pie: This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's  only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me,  isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, and she wishes  you all a happy Hearth's Warming! [beat] Marble Pie: Mm-hmm. Applejack: [hushed, to Apple Bloom] Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her. Apple Bloom: [giggles] Pinkie Pie: [whistles] Attention! Limestone Pie: What'd I say about the boulder?! Pinkie Pie: I'll just be a second. Everypony get settled  in! There's plenty of room upstairs. And then it's time for Hearth's  Warming Eve dinner! [confetti exploding] Applejack: [hushed] So far, so good, cousin! Pinkie Pie: Hee-hee! [bed springs bouncing] Apple Bloom: Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner. Granny Smith: I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself! Apple Bloom: I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours? Applejack: Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least. Pinkie Pie: Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert – it's me! [soup pouring] [splash] Applejack: What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie? Granny Smith: Uh, what about six-layer bean dip? Maud Pie: [deadpan] We have rock soup. Pinkie Pie: Potato, po-tah-to. Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner. Am I right or am I right? [beat] Applejack: Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony? Big McIntosh and Granny Smith: [uncertain noises] Applejack: [laughs nervously] Pinkie Pie: [slurping, exhales] Is everything all right, Applejack? Applejack: O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle. Tune me up and let's get back to dinner. [slurping] [gag, coughs] Pinkie Pie: More rock, please! [soup pouring] Pinkie Pie: Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls! Applejack: Now that's somethin' I know all about! [picking noises] Pinkie Pie: Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll? Applejack: Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll? Pinkie Pie: Don't be silly, silly! [picking noise] [crumbling] Pinkie Pie: Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie? [beat] Marble Pie: Mm-hmm. [picking noises] Apple Bloom: Our dolls are... rocks? [snap] [crunch] Applejack: Uh... y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family? Pinkie Pie: Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock. Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission! Applejack: The what findin' what now? Pinkie Pie: Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac,  Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two! Ma,  Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith. Don't think of it as team old. Think of it as team three! And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins! Applejack: So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'? Pinkie Pie: As everypony knows— Limestone Pie: Stay off Holder's Boulder! Pinkie Pie: Sheesh. When the three tribes united to form  Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble. It's tradition to  raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day. Other ponies: [general agreement] Pinkie Pie: But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder? Applejack: You mean on the flagpole? Pinkie Pie: No, silly, it goes on the highest point! And who's the lucky pony? Applejack: Traditionally, it's the youngest— Pinkie Pie: [quickly] On your marks, get set, go! Applejack: Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on? Pinkie Pie: I'll explain on the way! Applejack: [yelps] Applejack: I still don't understand. Pinkie Pie: Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone. Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag! Applejack: It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based. Pinkie Pie: Well, how else would we do it? Applejack: I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time. Marble Pie: Mm-hmm. Big McIntosh: Eeyup. Marble Pie: Mm-hmm. Big McIntosh: Eeeeeeeeeyup. Granny Smith: So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller? Cloudy Quartz: We were chosen by the Pairing Stone and betrothed within a fortnight. Igneous Rock: The choosing stone decreed, "Thou shalt love one another." And lo, it was so. Granny Smith: Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing. You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks? Igneous Rock: Indeed so. Cloudy Quartz: [simultaneously] Mmm. Apple Bloom: What does the rock look like? Maud Pie: [deadpan] It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly. Apple Bloom: Oh. Maud Pie: [deadpan] Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock? Apple Bloom: I had a dream once I was an apple. Maud Pie: [deadpan] We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things. Pinkie Pie: Found it, found it, found it! Applejack: A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie! Pinkie Pie: Um, that would be weird. Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents! Applejack: Y'all hide your presents? Pinkie Pie: Of course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one. Applejack: So nopony gets presents? Pinkie Pie: Eh, not usually. Applejack: So lemme get all this straight. You're only  allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock  gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole,  and to top it off, you don't even get presents?! Pinkie Pie: Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way. Applejack: Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...? Pinkie Pie: Picturing it... Loving it...! Pinkie Pie: Goodnight, everypony! Applejack: Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'! Granny Smith: Is that really what she said? Applejack: Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant. Apple Bloom: These are their traditions. Big McIntosh: Eeyup. Applejack: [sighs] I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be. [rooster crows] Pinkie Pie: Hearth's Warming! [thump] Pinkie Pie: Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's— [strangles out] Igneous Rock: Oh, my. Oh, my. Limestone Pie: What. Happened. To. My. Farm! Applejack: It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've  been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit!  Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because  you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll  never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em! Pinkie Pie: ...Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said. Right, everypony? Igneous Rock: Pinkamena Diane Pie! Truly thou cannot favor this madness! Pinkie Pie: Well, I wanna be one big family! Limestone Pie: But what about what we usually do?! Pinkie Pie: I, um, well, I-I don't know! [tearing up] Don't make me choose! Applejack: I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see! Maud Pie: Excuse me. You planted your pole on a fault line. [rumbling, cracking, thud] Limestone Pie: Nooooooooooooooo! [crunch] Applejack: Oh, boy. [bell ringing] Pinkie Pie: You didn't have to ask them to leave! Limestone Pie: They wanted to go! We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family! Pinkie Pie: This was all a misunderstanding, everypony! I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony! Limestone Pie: Look around, Pinkie Pie! It's gonna take  me ages to get this rock farm back on track! And how are we gonna lift  Holder's Boulder?! This is all her fault! Pinkie Pie: Then it's my fault too... [thud] Granny Smith: Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet  Apple Acres. Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's  best if we give them a little space. Apple Bloom: I wish we didn't have to. I really like Maud. She's sweet once you get to know her. They all are. Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever. Granny Smith: Eh, has anypony seen Applejack? Applejack: [sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time. Pinkie Pie: [sniffling] I really popped the piñata this time. Applejack: Pinkie Pie? Pinkie Pie: [yelps] What are you doing here? Applejack: What are you doin' here? Applejack and Pinkie Pie: [simultaneously] I came here to think! You did? So did I! [laughing] Aww. Applejack: I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop. Pinkie Pie: Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping. Sorry. Applejack: I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I  don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into  and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one  big happy family. I guess not. Pinkie Pie: Don't say that! [train whistle blows] Applejack: I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch. Pinkie Pie: [crying] H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming. Applejack: [tearing up] You too. [train noises] Granny Smith: You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so  danged important? [exhales] Well, now their  great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone – he  found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built  the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock. It  always brought them good luck. Applejack: Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em! [smack] Applejack: [reading] To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever. Apple Bloom: You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever! Applejack: [laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train. ...What a great tradition. [beat] Stop the train! Pie family: [straining] Pinkie Pie: [straining] Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh! Maud Pie: [deadpan] I'm pushing as hard as I can too. Pie family: [straining] Limestone Pie: Rrrgh, it's hopeless! Applejack: Need a little help? Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Apples! Limestone Pie: What do you want?! Applejack: I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away,  I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy  family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I  should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over  time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all. [beat] Limestone Pie: Well, don't just stand there! We got a boulder to move! And I'm in charge. Apple family and Pie family: [straining] Pinkie Pie: I think we've just invented our first  combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry!  [squeals] I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's  Warming! Apple family and Pie family: [laughing] Apple Bloom: [swallows] Pinkie Pie: Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! And you too, right, Big Mac? Marble Pie: Mm-hmm! Big McIntosh: [short giggle] Eeyup. Granny Smith: Eh, lemme see here, uh... 'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'. Igneous Rock: 'Yee-haw'. [paper ripping] Pinkie Pie: Happy Hearth's Warming! Applejack: Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie. Apple Bloom: Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote! Apple family and Pie family: [various cheers] Maud Pie: [deadpan] The first one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. [reading, deadpan] Hearth's Warming is great. Like calcium silicate. What a wonderful day. As good as mica or clay. [carol-type music plays over credits]			<br>

'Cause to lose this day would be a shame There's a rainbow waitin', a song is playin' And I can't wait to hit the road with you There's a rainbow waitin' And we got rainbow road-trippin' to do!  [music] Pinkie Pie: [singsongy] Road trip! [normal] Okay, not technically a road trip, because we're taking that. Uh-huh. Whoa! Rainbow Dash: Beat ya to the balloon! Pinkie Pie: Nope! I'm gonna beat you! [zip!] [zip!] Pinkie Pie: [humming] Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Pinkie Pie: Whoa! [both grunting] Pinkie Pie: I'm gonna beat you! Rainbow Dash: No, I'm gonna— [gasps] Pinkie Pie: Eep! Applejack: Howdy. Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [grunting] Rainbow Dash: [panting] Okay, I was fourth. Pinkie Pie: Yeah? Well, I was fifth! [giggles] Rainbow Dash: That's not even—! Pinkie Pie: Aw, yeah! Rainbow Dash: But I beat you! Applejack: Y'all are both still late! We gotta shove off soon, or we'll miss the tailwind. Fluttershy: Don't worry. We wouldn't have left without you. Rarity: Well, that goes without saying, darling. After all, Rainbow Dash is the guest of honor at the Rainbow Festival. [whoosh!] Rainbow Dash: Ha-ha! Fluttershy: Has anypony seen Twilight? It's not like her to be late for an adventure. Twilight Sparkle: I'm coming, I'm coming! [panting] Spike: [grunting] Twilight Sparkle: [panting] Sorry. I just had to pack up a few books and papers to grade. Spike: [straining] And by "few", she means "slightly less than I'm able to lift"! [grunts] Rainbow Dash: Wait. You're bringing work to a festival? Pinkie Pie: Yeah! It's supposed to be a nonstop fun-o-rama party! Rest of the Mane Six: Yeah! Twilight Sparkle: Grading papers is fun. It's relaxing and rewarding and— Applejack: Too much to talk about right now. [grunts] [flame igniting] Spike: [grunts, sighs] Applejack: Let 'er loose, Spike! Twilight Sparkle: Keep an eye on things for me, and feel free to file those class assignments while I'm gone. Spike: It's my top priority. Have fun, everypony! [music, music stops] Fluttershy: Um, why aren't we going anywhere? Applejack: Hmm. The basket's too heavy. Rainbow Dash: Rarity? Rarity: How dare you! I brought the itsy-est valise! Applejack: Sorry to do this, Twilight, but... [grunts] Twilight Sparkle: My papers! [whistling] [thud] Spike: [grunts] Ugh. Applejack: They'll keep 'til we get back. Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Rainbow Dash: Miss us! Pinkie Pie: Bye-bye! Twilight Sparkle: Keep an eye on things! Spike: See ya! And remember, whatever happens at the Rainbow Festival, I wanna hear all about it when you get back! [Mane Six giving various goodbyes] [traveling music] [birds chirping] Rarity: Did somepony mention something about a spa in... where is it we're going again? Rainbow Dash: Hope Hollow. Or, as I like to call it... [whoosh] Rainbow Dash: "Rainbow Dash Fan Central"! Applejack: Ugh. You're gonna be like this the whole trip, ain't ya? Rainbow Dash: You know it! I mean, look at this letter! They love me there! Twilight Sparkle: [reading] "Dear Rainbow Dash, thank  you for agreeing to be our guest at this year's famous Hope Hollow  Rainbow Festival. The many members of your fan club..." Rainbow Dash: [clears throat] Applejack: [sighs] Twilight Sparkle: [continues reading] "...are looking  forward to your visit. You and your friends will be staying at our  famous luxury Rainbow Resort and Spa, where your every whim will be  catered to." Rarity: Oh, I accept that challenge. I have so many whims. Fluttershy: Oh, look. There's a famous butterfly garden, too. Twilight Sparkle: Hmm. Y'know, it's strange that we  never heard of this festival before, especially since everything in the  town is so well-known. Rainbow Dash: [reading] "At this year's festival, you  can eat treats at the traditional Rainbow Bakery Booth, sing your  favorite rainbow-themed songs at the karaoke competition..." Pinkie Pie: Bakery and karaoke?! It's like they see into my soul! Applejack: [reading] "...and try our famous rainbow trout catch-and-release activity." Huh. Now that sounds right up my river. Pinkie Pie: Plus, we get to watch the mayor give Rainbow Dash an award! I call dibs on the cheering section! [squeals] [party cannon] Rarity: An award for what, exactly? Rainbow Dash: I 'unno. Showing up? General coolness? [laughs] All of the above? Twilight Sparkle: Well, we're so glad you invited us along. Pinkie Pie: Yeah! It's gonna be one long party, which starts... now! A hundred bottles of pop on the wall A hundred bottles of pop  [Mane Six] Take one down, pass it around Ninety-nine bottles of pop on the wall Ninety-nine bottles of pop on the wall Ninety-nine bottles of pop... [fades out] [Pinkie Pie] Two bottles of pop on the wall Two bottles of pop Take it down, pass it around One bottle of pop on the wall And a-one more time! A hundred bottles of pop on the wall  [muffled speaking] Six times too many? Rainbow Dash: Ugh. Shouldn't we be there by now? Applejack: Huh. I thought so, too. Maybe we should've turned left at that last cloud instead o' right. Fluttershy: Ooh, it's getting darker by the minute. Rarity: I can't see anything! Oh. Pinkie Pie: I spy with my little eye... a rainbow! Rainbow Dash: Great. We're playing that game now? Pinkie Pie: No, I really do spy a rainbow! Mane Six: [awed reactions] Twilight Sparkle: Wow! That's the biggest rainbow I've ever seen. Rarity: [panicked] And we're headed right for it! Rainbow Dash: Don't worry. We'll pass right through it. Rainbows aren't solid. [thud] Mane Six: [gasping] Applejack: Tell that to the rainbow. Twilight Sparkle: I don't think that's a rainbow. It's a rainbow billboard! [creaking] Fluttershy: Oh, no! Twilight Sparkle: Hang on, everypony! [air escaping] Mane Six: [screaming] Pinkie Pie: [blowing] Rarity: I don't think that working! Applejack: We're gonna craaaaash! Mane Six: [resume screaming] Mane Six: [screaming] Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, let's get everypony out! [music] [teleportation zap] Mane Six: [sighing] [crash] Mane Six: [scream] Pinkie Pie: [coughs] Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie: [gasp] Applejack: Phew! Thanks, y'all. That basket could've been us. Fluttershy: Where... are we? Pinkie Pie: Uh-huh! [reading sign] "Welcome to Hope Hollow: Home of the Famous..." [crash] Pinkie Pie: [resumes reading] "...Rainbow Festival"! Rarity: We've arrived, and there's nopony here to greet us? Twilight Sparkle: Good thing, too. The guest of honor and her friends just destroyed the town sign. Fluttershy: Rainbow Dash, did your letter say where our hotel is? Rainbow Dash: Uh... [reading] "The middle of town". Twilight Sparkle: Hmm... Doesn't really help much when you don't know where the middle is. Let's start looking. [music] [spooky music] [sign creaking] Applejack: Huh. Funny. You'd think a big luxury resort would be sorta, well... easier to spot. Pinkie Pie: Yeah! It seems like the whole town's shut down. Fluttershy: Oh, look. There's somepony. Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm. Hello! Petunia Petals: [gasps] Oh. Twilight Sparkle: Maybe you can help us. We're here for the Rainbow Festival. Petunia Petals: [Minnesota accent] Oh, uh, "Rainbow Festival"? Rainbow Dash: Yeah, you know, the one where I'm the guest of honor? [laughs] Yeah! Petunia Petals: Oh, for cryin' in the mud, what's Sunny done now? Applejack: Excuse me? Petunia Petals: I mean, um, you'd best talk to Mayor Skies about that. Twilight Sparkle: Great! And where would we find him? Petunia Petals: City hall. Uh, but it's closed 'til tomorrow, don'tcha know? Is there somethin' I can help ya with? Rarity: Uh, yes, please. Could you direct us to the Hope Hollow Luxury Resort? Petunia Petals: [giggles] [beat] Petunia Petals: Oh! Oh, you mean the hotel? Mane Six: Mm-hmm. Petunia Petals: That's easy. There's only one in town. Applejack: Could you, uh, give us directions? Petunia Petals: No need. You're there. [doors open] Petunia Petals: I mean here! [music] [lights click] Petunia Petals: Hotel Hope, also known as the Town Information Center and Library! My name's Petunia Petals, by the way. Helloooo! [zip!] Petunia Petals: I'm the librarian here and the information guide... [ding!] Petunia Petals: ...and the hotel manager, historian, chef, portrait painter— Rainbow Dash: Um, I'm Rainbow Dash, and this is everypony. Rarity and Pinkie Pie: Hello. Applejack: Howdy. Petunia Petals: Well, hello, everypony! You just wait one hoofshake, and I'll take ya to the room. Rarity: The room? Petunia Petals: There's only one. Makes it easier to find! [chuckles] [music] Petunia Petals: Here it is! The Royal Suite! [door opens] Mane Six: [gasp] [lights flickering] Rarity: [gasping dramatically] How rustic and charming. Petunia Petals: Isn't it just? Rainbow Dash: I couldn't help noticing there are only three beds. [thud] Rainbow Dash: Okay, four. Pentuina Petals: Oh, there's a pop-out, too! [grunts] It can be a little tricky. [thud] Petunia Petals: There she is. Sleeps two. You'll be all fresh and ready to see the mayor in the mornin'. [door opens] Petunia Petals: Sleep tight. [door closes] [shatter] Twilight Sparkle: Did anypony notice anything strange about Petunia? Rarity: Other than that she just called this place "the Royal Suite"? Applejack: Hard to tell in this light, but she looked a little gray, didn't she? Rarity: Probably from all the dust up here. [blows, coughs] Pinkie Pie: Aw, this room's not so bad. All it needs is some balloons, streamers... [humming] And... a piñata! Good thing I brought some! Fluttershy: Huh? And look. It comes with a cute little spider. Hello, spider. [spider squeaks] Fluttershy: Awww. Rainbow Dash: [groans] Sorry, everypony. I didn't know what I was getting you into. Twilight Sparkle: Aw. The most important thing is we're all together. Applejack: Yeah. As long as we have beds to sleep in, we're set. [fwip!] Applejack: Whoa! Ugh. [music] Twilight Sparkle: Well... [yawns] ...it wasn't the worst night of sleep ever. Rarity: But definitely in the top three... or would that be the bottom three? [ponies murmuring] Fluttershy: Why is everypony looking at us? Applejack: Maybe they recognize Rainbow Dash. Rainbow Dash: Or Princess Twilight. But probably me. Rarity: No. I think they're staring because we're the only part of this town that isn't... gray. Pinkie Pie: Whadaya mean? Rarity: Look around. All the colors here are gone! Twilight Sparkle: That's so strange. It's just like I noticed about Petunia last night. Everything's mostly gray. Petunia Petals: Oh! Hellooo! Applejack: Except the stuff that's grayer. Fluttershy: Oh, my. I knew something was <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span>, but— Rainbow Dash: This is so weird! Man Pony: Huh? Rarity: And the way they're gawking at us, it appears they think we're the odd ones. Fluttershy: Maybe they don't even notice. It might be rude to mention it. Twilight Sparkle: I wonder what caused this. Applejack: We can ask the mayor. Rainbow Dash: Yeah, if we ever find him. [ponies whispering] Barley Barrel and Pickle Barrel: [grunting] Barley Barrel: Quit shoving! Pickle Barrel: Shoving? These are pro-level moves I'm doing, sis. Yeah— Ohhh! Barley Barrel: C'mon! Let go! Barley Barrel and Pickle Barrel: [gasp, grunt, gasp again] [angelic choir] [beat] [zip!] Barley Barrel and Pickle Barrel: [whispering indistinctly] Mrs. Hoofington: [upper-class accent] Don't pout, dear. It'll wrinkle your withers. Mr. Hoofington: [upper-class accent] I'm not pouting, sweetums, but I am hurt by your comment. I thought the pie I baked was quite tasty. Mrs Hoofington: I didn't say it wasn't. Mr. Hoofington: You didn't say it was. Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington: Oh! Moody Root: Watch where you're goin'! You don't own the sidewalk, ya know?! Mr. Hoofington: Well, I never! Mrs. Hoofington: Ugh. Mr. Hoofington: Huh? Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington: Oh! Mane Six: Huh? [crane cranking] Applejack: Well, look at that. Somepony's fixin' up our balloon. Mayor Sunny Skies: [Minnesota accent] Oh, goodness. This is unfortunate. Bad with a side of terribly awful. [to Mane Six] Excuse me. Sorry. Mane Six: [angry reactions] Mayor Sunny Skies: [sighs] Eh? Ohhh! [laughs] Well, stuff me in an olive and call me a pimento! It's the Rainbow Dash! Ya made it! Uh, it is.. you, isn't it? Rainbow Dash: Pretty sure, yeah. Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, thank Celestia! I saw the  balloon, thought the worst, and... Well, you're here, all o' ya! Welcome  to the Hope Hollow Annual Rainbow Festival! Twilight Sparkle: I'm Twilight Sparkle, and you must be... Mayor Sunny Skies: Sunny Skies, the mayor o' this lovely town, and pleased as a poplar tree to meetcha! Fluttershy: We're very sorry about your rainbow billboard, Mr. Mayor. It was dark and— Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, don't give it a second thought.  That old thing needed repair anyway. I haven't used it since... uh...  well, never mind. Uh, a-a-anyway, once your balloon's fixed up, Torque  can take care of the billboard. Everypony, meet Torque Wrench, our town  handypony. She offered to repair your balloon for ya. Torque Wrench: He volunteered me. Mayor Sunny Skies: She'll have it fixed in a jiffy. Torque Wrench: If, by "jiffy", ya mean "this will take all day". [torch flame] Mayor Sunny Skies: Sooo ya got in last night. I wish I'd known. I would've been here to greetcha. Uh, where'd y'all stay? Rarity: At the "Luxury Hotel". Applejack: Petunia Petals let us in. Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, well, of course she did. She's somethin', I'll tell you what. I'd be lost without her. I mean, uh, th-the town would be. [beat] Twilight Sparkle: Mayor, I hope you don't mind my asking, but is there a reason your town is... faded? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh! Heh. Ya spotted that, did ya? Well, it's a... long story. Uh, why don't I show you the town highlights first? Mane Six: [confused reactions] [plop] Mayor Sunny Skies: Here's our famous outdoor spa with the all-natural mud bath. Pretty, huh? [plop] Rarity: Ah! Ugh. Twilight Sparkle: Maybe we could see some of the Rainbow Festival activities from the brochure. Mayor Sunny Skies: O' course! The bakery booth is there... Fluttershy: Huh? Twilight Sparkle: Hmm? Mayor Sunny Skies: Or... will be. We're... still settin' up, but we gotta lotta great things planned. Fluttershy: And... the butterfly garden? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, that's right over here. Twilight Sparkle and Applejack: Huh. [paper falling] Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, uh, lemme fix that. Fluttershy: So none of the butterflies are actually... Mayor Sunny Skies: Real? Oh, no. Uh, what with the flowers not havin' color and all, the butterflies don't really come around much anymore. Applejack: I'm almost afraid to ask, but the brochure mentioned fishin'? Mayor Sunny Skies: Fishin'? Oh, I'm not sure whatcha mean. Twilight Sparkle: "Our famous rainbow trout"? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, yah, sure! Uh, well, uh, you  don't fish for him exactly. You just kinda, uh, talk to him. Uh, he's  right over, uh... [sighs] That's funny. Where'd our trout go? Trout Pony: Oh, Mr. Mayor! Uh, just, uh, taking my lunch now, okay? [slurp!] Mayor Sunny Skies: [chuckles nervously] Pinkie Pie: Um, so no big deal – well, actually, okay,  yes, kind of a big deal – but the brochure also mentioned a karaoke  contest? [blink, blink] Mayor Sunny Skies: Right here! [sign falls] [thud] [microphone feedback] Mayor Sunny Skies: The trout doubles on harmonica. Trout Pony: [toots harmonica] Fluttershy: How... multitalented of him. Pinkie Pie: Good thing I bring my own karaoke party! With me wherever I go Whoa, whoa-oh!  Mayor Sunny Skies: Well, uh... that's the big tour. [hums] Twilight Sparkle: Mayor Skies. Mayor Sunny Skies: Eh? Twilight Sparkle: I don't understand. Your Rainbow Festival isn't quite as you described. Rainbow Dash: And the resort hotel wasn't what it was cracked up to be either. Applejack: 'Cept for all the cracks. Rarity: None of these things are as pictured in your brochure. Mayor Sunny Skies: Well, maybe I exaggerated a little,  but I-I'd intended on havin' everythin' ready. It's just kinda hard  gettin' anypony excited about anythin' in this town anymore! Ugh. I didn't think ya'd come if ya knew the truth. Twilight Sparkle: The truth? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh... There is no Rainbow Festival! Mane Six: [gasp] Applejack: No Rainbow Festival?! Rainbow Dash: No fan club?! Mayor Sunny Skies: Believe me, I didn't mean to— Rainbow Dash: Bring us here for nothing?! Twilight Sparkle: Think of all the papers I could be grading! Mayor Sunny Skies: If ya just let me— Rarity: We should just leave this very moment! Applejack: Balloon's not fixed yet. Fluttershy: Maybe we should let the mayor explain. Mayor Sunny Skies: [clears throat] Uh, guess I should  start at the beginnin'. A long time ago, when my Grandpa Skies was  mayor, Hope Hollow was <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span>. They used to call this town "The End  of the Rainbow", 'cause everything you'd ever want, you could find right  here. [Mayor Sunny Skies] Next door neighbors chatting over white-wood fences Stoppin' on the street to say hello When friends did well, we sang their praises Brought soup to comfort them when they felt low That was our town at the end of the rainbow No pots of gold or buried treasure Just everypony looking after each other The truest riches cannot be measured It was a lesson that had kept us together In our town at the end of the rainbow To honor our fine town, my Grandpa Skies decided To throw a party each and every year They planned for weeks, cooked for days, celebrated fifty ways So everypony would gather here In our town at the end of the rainbow Grandpa made a gizmo called the Rainbow Generator To paint the sky with lots of colors shining bold and bright To remind us all together we are greater And darkness never wins against the coming of the light Grandpa passed it on to Dad, then it was my turn To make the pretty rainbows in the sky It filled my heart with pride to see our whole town gathered gratefully Where we were sure there would never be An end to the rainbow Then fences went up, we lost track of our neighbors Each year passing, dimming spirits all around The happy days came to an end Nopony had time to spend together in the town I thought I knew exactly what the festival needed A bigger, better rainbow would surely make them see it But the extra magic was too much for the Rainbow Generator And I'm the one who brought the rainbow to an end That's how our town, our little pony town That's how our town saw the end of the rainbow  Pinkie Pie: [bawls] That is the saddest story-song I've ever heard! Mayor Sunny Skies: I tried for a long time to get  everypony interested in the Festival again. To remember what it's like  to come together as a community and share the fun. But nopony even  bothered listenin'. That's why I wrote to you, Rainbow Dash. You  were my last hope. I figured if a pony of your stature came to town, it  would get everypony excited about puttin' on the Festival again. I mean,  "Rainbow"'s even part o' your name! Rainbow Dash: Mmm, yeah, I can see that. Twilight Sparkle: Mr. Mayor, what kind of magic did you use on the Rainbow Generator? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, I'm not sure. I didn't know what I  was dealin' with. I only wanted to help. But instead, I sucked all the  color outta the town. That billboard's one o' the only things that  didn't change. To me, it's a reminder of what we can be. Keeps the "Hope" in "Hope Hollow". Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm. If I could find out the type of magic you used, I might be able to reverse the spell. Mayor Sunny Skies: Ya mean, you're gonna stay? Mane Six: [agreeing] Applejack: Heh. Nothin' we like better than a challenge, 'specially when it comes to helpin' ponies. Mayor Sunny Skies: You don't know how clam-happy this all makes me! Thank you kindly! Twilight Sparkle: We'll do whatever we can to bring back your Rainbow Festival. Mayor Sunny Skies: I won't fib to ya, it won't be easy. It's gotten so nopony even talks to each other anymore. Twilight Sparkle: Mmm, it might be tough, but we have a little experience bringing ponies together. Pinkie Pie: Yay! This is exactly like planning a party! Only bigger, 'cause it's a festival! [giggles] Which means more cupcakes! Whoo-hoo! Ooh. Ah! I've got a date with the Bakery Booth! Ha-ha! [zip!] Pinkie Pie: [giggling rhythmically] Fluttershy: Um... I'd better go with her. Rarity: Hmmm, an overall stylistic look to unify the sentiment of the celebration. That's what this festival needs. Mayor Sunny Skies: Ya mean like a rainbow? Rarity: Yes, darling, yes, yes, but more complex, more thematic, something like— Ooh! something like that! Formidable! Twilight Sparkle: The biggest challenge is getting your  town interested in a Rainbow Festival when everything's so... gray. I  think if we can bring the color back, it'll solve everything. Mayor Sunny Skies: Yah, I'm with ya there, but— Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow Dash, I need your help. Rainbow Dash: Mr. Mayor, seriously, is there a fan club? Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, you betcha! They're around... somewhere. Rainbow Dash: Ugh. Applejack: Any tools I can borrow, your Honor? I'm gonna  spruce up that billboard to let everypony know this here Rainbow  Festival's back in business! Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh, that's music to my ears! Torque Wrench, let's get our guest tooled up, whadaya say? She's gonna put our rainbow back up. Torque Wrench: [sarcastically] Oh, yippee. [music] Petunia Petals: Heh-heh. Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh! Uh, if ya don't mind, I, uh, I have a speech to work on. See ya 'round. Applejack: Hmm. Rainbow Dash: So... what's your plan? Twilight Sparkle: If magic caused this, maybe magic can solve it. [music] [magic sounds] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Oh, I was afraid of that. I've never seen any magic like this before. Rainbow Dash: Heh. Let me try. I mean, "Rainbow"'s part of my name, right? [music] [whooshing] [boom!] [ponies exclaiming] Rainbow Dash: Ugh. Yeah, that's all I got. Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] Thanks for trying. I guess I need to do more research. [whooshing] Barley Barrel: Look out! Pickle Barrel: No, you look out! Barley and Pickle Barrel: [screaming] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Barley and Pickle Barrel: [grunt] Pickle Barrel: [groans] Rainbow Dash: Are you okay? Barley and Pickle Barrel: Oh! Barley Barrel: Why did you zig in front of me like that? Pickle Barrel: I didn't zig! You zigged! I zagged! Barley Barrel: That's no excuse for—! Rainbow Dash: Guys, guys, hold on! It was just an accident. Pickle Barrel: An accident that happened in front of you. Barley Barrel: Ugh, I'm so embarrassed. All of our lives, we've been wanting to meet you, and— Rainbow Dash: Wait. So you're the fan club? [doing!] Barley Barrel: You've heard of us? Pickle Barrel: Barley's the president. Barley Barrel: Pickle's the assistant president. Rainbow Dash: Well, what do you know? The mayor was telling the truth about something! Barley Barrel: Anyway, you're my brother's favorite Wonderbolt! Pickle Barrel: And my sister's favorite Wonderbolt, too! Barley Barrel: He knows all your best moves! Pickle Barrel: So does she! Barley Barrel: We practice all of 'em, every day! Barley and Pickle Barrel: [grunting] Pickle Barrel: But we really can't do them. [to Barley] Well, it's true! Barley Barrel: [to Pickle] Go ahead. Ask her. Pickle Barrel: No, you ask her. Barley Barrel: No, you ask her! Pickle Barrel: No, you! Barley Barrel: No, you do it! Pickle Barrel: No, you do it! Barley Barrel: Mmm! Rainbow Dash: Somepony ask me! Barley Barrel: Do you think maybe... you could give us a lesson? Just a tiny one? Show us some of your moves? Rainbow Dash: Heh. Well, you promise to listen and work hard and practice? Barley and Pickle Barrel: [gasp] Pickle Barrel: Yes! Pickle Barrel: Absolutely, practice! Rainbow Dash: Heh, tell you what. If I like what I see, the three of us will put on a show at the Rainbow Festival. Barley and Pickle Barrel: Oh! Barley Barrel: There's still a Rainbow Festival? Pickle Barrel: And we're gonna perform at it? Rainbow Dash: I think the whole town should know there's a couple of future Wonderbolts living here. C'mon! We got work to do! [whoosh!] Barley Barrel: Did you hear that?! Pickle Barrel: She called us "future Wonderbolts"! [whoosh!] [magic sounds] Applejack: I think some o' this can be saved, but we'll need some fresh lumber. Uh, Torque, the mayor said maybe you could lend a hoof. Torque Wrench: [groans] Him and his crazy schemes. What's your business in this anyhoo? Hmm? Applejack: Well, for one thing, we're helpin' the mayor. And for another, Granny Smith always says, "You break somethin', you fix it. And any job you do, you should be proud of." Torque Wrench: [laughs] Proud of bein' the repairpony? [laughs] Applejack: Well, absolutely! It's a pretty rare talent  to have. Nice work on that balloon basket, by the way. Reweavin' all  that straw is no joke. Torque Wrench: Oh. Yah, well, thanks for, well, noticin'. Applejack: [grunts] [hammering] [magic sounds] Rarity: [humming] Hmm? That's one of my designs! Hello? Kerfuffle: [gasps] Whoa, no way! Stack my pancakes! Are you really the Rarity?! Rarity: Uh, it's just "Rarity". Uh, and I-I couldn't help but notice that you've got— Kerfuffle: [gasps] I love ya! I love ya so much! Your work, I mean! Your designs, your taste, your eye for beauty! Rarity: Well, thank you— Kerfuffle: They're the perfect canvas for me to fancy up! Rarity: Yes, about that. The— the hat, the— the boa, the scarf, the— Kerfuffle Do ya like 'em? Rarity: Very charming. Kerfuffle: [gasps] Thank ya! [giggles] Those are  Kerfuffle originals! I'm Kerfuffle! Spelled like it sounds, with a  double "ffff" for the "fuff"! [gasps] I should really stop talking now. Rarity: I do hope you don't mind my asking. But with all this talent, why don't you simply display your own work instead of adding to others? Kerfuffle: [laughs] Oh. Oh, no, I-I couldn't. It's... not good enough by itself. Rarity: Hmph, au contraire. Take this shawl. Hoof-dyed, nicely woven, a piece of art by itself. Imagine if you could work in color. Kerfuffle: Oh, I do imagine. I mean, that's how I design  things. I feel in my heart what the colors are. Like this scarf. This  stripe is red, then orange, yellow... Rarity: Like a rainbow. How would you like to work with me as the official assistant designer of the Rainbow Festival? Kerfuffle: [gasps] Really? Work with you?! I can't believe it! [laughs gleefully] Wait, there's still a Rainbow Festival? Rarity: Darling, if we have anything to do with it, not  only will there be a festival, it will be the most stylish anypony in  this town has ever seen! Now let's get started! [magic sounds] [music] [doors opening] Twilight Sparkle: Wow... [music continues] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Petunia Petals: Ya like it? Twilight Sparkle: I love it! I just never thought— Petunia Petals: That a teeny town like Hope Hollow would have a library this grand? We may be small, but we're well-read. I make sure of it. Twilight Sparkle: Mayor Sunny was right. You are something! Petunia Petals: Did he really say that? [giggles] Oh, that silly unicorn. Did he say anythin' else? I mean, uh, anyhoo, what can I do you for? Twilight Sparkle: I don't suppose you have a magic section? Petunia Petals: [laughs] "Arcane", "Elemental", or "Theory of"? Twilight Sparkle: [squeals] Pinkie Pie: Let's see. If fifty cupcakes makes a party, that means for the festival, we need... divide by two, carry the one... Fluttershy: More? Pinkie Pie: Super more! We're gonna need some baking help! [sign creaks] Fluttershy: [gasps] Pinkie Pie: Huh? [crack] Fluttershy: It looks like it's closed. Pinkie Pie: Aw, that's so sad. Mr. Hoofington: [distantly] We can only use the ones from our yard, lovey. Mrs. Hoofington: Oh, darling, stop it. Pinkie Pie: Excuse me. I see you're taking your pie for a walk, and I was wondering— Mrs. Hoofington: We're not interested. Ugh, it's getting so a pony can't even walk down the street without being terrorized. Pinkie Pie: [laughs] That's not terrorize. This... [babbles] Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington: Aah! Pinkie Pie: ...is terrorize. Mr. Hoofington: [sighs] Pinkie Pie: So, how would you like to be a part of the official baking team of the Rainbow Festival? Mrs. Hoofington: There's still a Rainbow Festival? Pinkie Pie: Uh-huh. We'll have a booth with cupcakes and  pastries and fun, and we're gonna start with this pie! Let the taste  test begin! [chomps, gags] Blech! Bleghhht! [gagging] What kind of pie  did you say this was s'upposed to be? Mr. Hoofington: Apricot. Pinkie Pie: Are you sure? It's kinda... crunchy. Fluttershy: Not that there's anything wrong with that. Mrs. Hoofington: Well, the apricots are from our very own tree. Mr. Hoofington: In our very own yard. Mrs. Hoofington: Behind our very own house. Pinkie Pie: Yeah. Maybe we should get a look at this tree. Barley and Pickle Barrel: [grunting] Rainbow Dash: All right, rookies. Show me what you got. Barley Barrel: [whispering, to Pickle] She sounds just like we always imagined she'd sound! Pickle Barrel: [whispering, to Barley] Only <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent cooler! Rainbow Dash: Well? Aren't you gonna fly or something? Pickle Barrel: Yes, sir! I mean, ma'am. Uh... Barley and Pickle Barrel: [chuckle nervously] [music] Barley Barrel: Okay? Break! Barley and Pickle Barrel: [groan] Whoa! [grunt, yell] [music] Rainbow Dash: Fancy flying is something you have to work up to. Even I didn't become "Rainbow Dash" in one day. Barley Barrel: Two days? Rainbow Dash: Everypony's got to learn the basics before they can show off. [whoosh] Barley and Pickle Barrel: Whoa! [music] Rainbow Dash: You'll get there. But first, let's start with a single flip. Barley and Pickle Barrel: [gasp] [magic sounds] Fluttershy: If you don't mind my asking, you don't sound like the other ponies here in town. Mr. Hoofington: Oh, we weren't born here. We're originally from Manehattan. Mrs. Hoofington: But it was so big. All those ponies crammed together, never talking to each other. Ooh. Mr. Hoofington: We heard Hope Hollow was just the opposite, so we moved here. Mrs. Hoofington: And it was wonderful... uh, for a while. Fluttershy: What happened? Mrs. Hoofington: Uh, things changed. Oh! Here. This is the tree. Mr. Hoofington: This is where the apricots in my pie came from. [beat] Pinkie Pie: Well, I'm no expert, but I don't think these are very ripe. Apricots are supposed to be orange. Mr. Hoofington: Well, that's the problem, isn't it? With hardly any colors in this town, one apricot looks like another. Fluttershy: What about that tree? Its apricots are big and juicy. Mr. Hoofington: Oh. We can't use the apricots from that tree. Pinkie Pie: Sure ya can! All you gotta do is— Moody Root: Hey! Stay away from my tree! Fluttershy: W-What was that? Mr. Hoofington: Just old Moody Root. Mrs. Hoofington: He's made it quite clear he won't share his apricots. He hasn't even said "hello" in ages. Fluttershy: Have you tried saying "hello" to him? Mr. Hoofington: What? Well, no, but— Fluttershy: Mr. Moody Root, are you there? Moody Root: Who wants to know? Fluttershy: I'm Fluttershy. Your apricot tree is beautiful. So healthy. You must take very good care of it. Moody Root: Well, I try to. Plant food. A good water now and then. Keeps my apricots happy. Fluttershy: I bet that's why you have so many of them. You must always be busy making things. Jam, cobbler, pie... Moody Root: Nope, I just eat 'em. Although, pie does sound pretty good. Mrs. Hoofington: What in Equestria is she doing? Mr. Hoofington: I haven't the foggiest, dear. Pinkie Pie: Doing what she does best. Fluttershy: Your neighbors were just about to bake some pies. You know them, right? Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington, Mr. Moody Root. Moody Root: Um... [clears throat] H-H-Hello, uh... Mr. Hoofington: Yes. Hello. Mrs. Hoofington: Hello, Mr... Root. Moody Root: [clears throat] Fluttershy: But they're a little short on apricots. Pinkie Pie: If only there was some apricots we can use... [clears throat, clears throat more irritably] Mrs. Hoofington: Oh, yes, of course! We'd be happy to bake you a pie. Mr. Hoofington: Two or... three pies even. Moody Root: So ya mean if I give ya my apricots... Pinkie Pie: [gasps] What a great idea! Fluttershy: Then everypony can share. What do you think, Mr. Moody Root? [sloop!] Mrs. Hoofington: Ugh. Oh, well. Fluttershy: Wait for it... [music building up] [gate opens] Moody Root: Got a ladder? We can just pick 'em from your side of the fence! Mr. Hoofington: Um, yes, of course! Uh, this way! [magic sounds] [music] [pages flipping] Twilight Sparkle: A prism curse? An erasure spell? None of these are big enough to make a whole town lose its color on their own! Ugh! Unless... Mayor Sunny Skies: [muffled] Oh, for the love o' cheddar! Twilight Sparkle: Huh? Mayor Sunny Skies: [muttering] Twilight Sparkle: Mayor Skies. Mayor Sunny Skies: Oh! Twilight Sparkle: What is all this? Mayor Sunny Skies: Princess Twilight! Welcome to our  town's Rainbow Room. Anything you want ta know about each year's  festival from the very beginnin'. Twilight Sparkle: The pictures! They're in color! Mayor Sunny Skies: Sure are. Oh. Those are from happier times. Back when there still was a festival. Seems even though we  faded, the memory never did. I come here sometimes for inspiration. I  need plenty for this speech I'm writin'. Biggest one of my life. [to  Petunia] Oh! Didn't see ya there! Petunia Petals: Sunny! I-I didn' know you were here. Mayor Sunny Skies: Uh, Uh, j-just leavin'. [chuckles] I-I gotta finish this. W-Well, uh, s-see ya later! Twilight Sparkle: Whoa. The festival was really something, wasn't it? Petunia Petals: Used to be wonderful. It brought the  whole town together for a long time, and these pictures are from the  last festival. You can see it didn't go well. Twilight Sparkle: Right. The mayor's magic in the generator caused the colors to go. Petunia Petals: That's what Sunny thinks. He blames himself for it, but I'm still not convinced it was anythin' other than an accident! Twilight Sparkle: There's something strange about this. I just can't put my hoof on it. If only the Generator hadn't been destroyed... Petunia Petals: Not all of it was. Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Petunia Petals: [grunts] Twilight Sparkle: Wow! Petunia Petals: I don't keep it out because I know it hurts th' mayor to see it. Twilight Sparkle: Mind if I borrow this? [music] Mayor Sunny Skies: [laughs] Great job! It's even better than it was before, don'tcha know? [ponies chattering] Pony #1: Rainbow Festival? Pony #2: Didn't know it was still goin' on. Mayor Sunny Skies: Sure is! Bigger and better than ever! I hope. Tell all your friends! Colt: Can we go, Mama? Pony #2: I suppose so. Why not? [magic sounds] Colt: [gasps, laughs] Twilight Sparkle: Mr. Mayor. [grunts] I hope you don't mind, but— Mayor Sunny Skies: Where'd ya find that? Petunia Petals: I gave it to her, Sunny. She has an idea. Mayor Sunny Skies: Best idea would just be to throw that thing in the trash heap. Twilight Sparkle: My theory is that the Generator  magnifies whatever magic it uses, makes it stronger. So if we could  rebuild it and use one of the reversal spells I just read about, it  could work to bring color back to the town! Mayor Sunny Skies: Even if we could get it workin' again, which is quite a tall order... Applejack Not for a gifted repairpony who I just happen to know. Torque Wrench: Let me take a look-see. Yah, I could give 'er a go. Mayor Sunny Skies: Huh. I don't wanna get my hope up, but... yahoo! Torque Wrench: Don't worry. I'll get to work. Petunia Petals: Um, how's your speech comin', Sunny? I'd be happy to help you with it if you'd like. Mayor Sunny Skies: Uh, oh, no, you couldn't. Uh,  t-thanks, but, uh, I have to do a little mayor-type business, don'tcha  know? But I'll check back in a little bit to see how everythin's goin'. [zip!] Petunia Petals: Hmmm. He's actin' so peculiar. Applejack: From what I've seen of the mayor, how can ya tell exactly when "peculiar" kicks in? [music] Moody Root: [chomping] Mm-mm-mm-mm! If I'd have known your pie was this good, I'd have given you those apricots ages ago! Mrs. Hoofington: Mr. Hoofington did all the baking. Mr. Hoofington: Mmm, inspired by you, Snookums. Mwah. Moody Root: Say, the whole town should know about this here pie. Pinkie Pie: Oh, don't worry. They will. We're gonna give it away at the Rainbow Festival! Moody Root: Wait, what? There's still a Rainbow Festival? Fluttershy: Uh-huh. Moody Root: [laughs] [magic sounds] [ding] Torque Wrench: Well, here it is. Had to hoof-build some of the parts myself, but it's as good as new. Applejack: Hoo-wee! This looks amazin', Torque. Nopony else could have pulled this off. Twilight Sparkle: Thank you so much for your help. Torque Wrench: It was a real challenge, but turns out that was part of the fun! [chuckles] [music] [magic sounds] Applejack: Whoa! D-Did y'all see that? Twilight Sparkle: Now we need to test it. Petunia Petals: Should we call the mayor? Twilight Sparkle: Might be best to make sure it works first. I'd hate to disappoint him. Applejack: Uh, Twilight, I think I saw— Twilight Sparkle: In a moment, Applejack. This is important. Applejack: Yeah, but— Twilight Sparkle: Turn on the Generator. Applejack: Oh. Okay. [clicking and whirring] Twilight Sparkle and Petunia Petals: [gasp] Applejack and Torque Wrench: [gasp] [machinery continues] [sheen!] Applejack: Huh! Well, look at that! Petunia Petals: Oh, isn't it beautiful? That's what the Generator has always done for years and years. Twilight Sparkle: Now we just add magic, and... [boom!] Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Petunia Petals, and Torque Wrench: [sigh] [music] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] I'm sorry. I thought for sure it would work. Petunia Petals: Let's not tell the mayor. It would break his heart. Twilight Sparkle: No. We have to tell him we failed. We can't bring the color back. Applejack: Hmm... Twilight! I really think you should see this. You betcha— Pinkie Pie: We did it! Twilight Sparkle and Petunia Petals: Huh? Applejack: [sighs] Pinkie Pie: [humming] Everything you need for the Rainbow Festival bake sale! Moody Root: [grunts] Fluttershy: Courtesy of the Hoofingtons. Mr. Hoofington: And Mr. Moody Root! Moody Root: [chuckles] Twilight Sparkle: Ooh! Everything looks delicious! Petunia Petals: Mr. Moody Root! Why, I haven't see ya in the library in ages. Moody Root: High time I came back. Hey, you got any of them there cookbooks? [whoosh!] Moody Root: Wha? Barley and Pickle Barrel: [laughing] [music] Torque Wrench: Hey, they're pretty good. Rainbow Dash: They've been practicing their tails off for the big show. [whoosh!] Torque Wrench: What big show? Rainbow Dash: The Rainbow Festival. They're the official entertainment. [music] Barley Barrel: Mm! Barley and Pickle Barrel: [grunting] [thud] Rainbow Dash: Uh, landing still needs a little work. Rarity: You're all here! Wonderful! You can help us set up our cart. Kerfuffle's official Rainbow Festival accessories. Kerfuffle: Ta-da! Rainbow Dash: Heh, whoa-ho-ho! Nice stuff. Kerfuffle: And I designed color-matched assessories for each of ya! Pinkie Pie: Um, I can't help but notice that the color-matched accessories don't have much color. Rarity: Well, of course not, silly. The town doesn't have any color, remember? Pinkie Pie: Oh, right. Kerfuffle: Oh, but don't worry. I know where the colors are supposed to be. An orange scarf for Applejack, red leggings fer Fluttershy... Fluttershy: Ooh. Kerfuffle: The pink flower lei is for, well, you-know-who. Pinkie Pie: No, who? [laughs] Mm-hmm. Rarity: And look at my purple kerchief. Isn't it divine? Kerfuffle: The blue goggles are fer Rainbow Dash. Rainbow Dash: Oh-ho-ho. Kerfuffle: [to Barley and Pickle] And I think I have some that might match for you two. Pickle Barrel: Whoa! Barley Barrel: Whoa! Kerfuffle: And somethin' very special for Princess Twilight. Wing bling! In every shade of the rainbow, don'tcha know? Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Kerfuffle, this is amazing!  Everypony, you've done great work. [sighs] I just wish I could've done  my part. I hate to admit it, but I'm stuck. I don't know how to make the  town's color come back. Applejack: [spits] That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya! It is comin' back! [magic sounds] [ponies exclaim] [magic sounds continue] Pickle Barrel: Whoa! Fluttershy: What's happening? Rarity: Something wonderful! Twilight Sparkle: But how? It wasn't the Generator. Which means something else must have drained the town's color in the first place! I have to get back to the library! Twilight Sparkle: I thought so! Look. In the second photo, when the Generator goes off, this pony is walking away. But on the third photo, when all the color's gone, he's back where he was. Which means... Petunia Petals: [gasps] We have to tell the mayor! Mayor Sunny Skies: Tell me what? Petunia Petals: Sunny! Have you seen what's happenin' outside? Mayor Sunny Skies: No, I've been in here fer a while workin' on my speech. Twilight Sparkle: Maybe we should just show him. Mr. Hoofington: Who wants apricot pies? Best pies in Hope Hollow! Mrs. Hoofington: Pies for sale! Yummylicious! Pony #2: Hello there, Mr. Hoofington, Mrs. Hoofington. Been a while. Mrs. Hoofington: How lovely to see you. [magic sounds] Mr. Hoofington: [gasps] Mrs. Hoofington: Oh! Pinkie Pie: What's better than one pie? Lots of pies! Official Rainbow Festival goodness right here now! [magic sounds] Moody Root: [gasps] Rarity: Over here, darlings! Just look what Kerfuffle has come up with! Customer #1: I never knew you did such great work. I have to visit your shop. Trout Pony: Hey, ya got anythin' waterproof? Kerfuffle: Mm-hmm. Whoa! [magic sounds] Mayor Sunny Skies: [gasps] Oh! But... colors! So you were able to reverse the Generator? Petunia Petals: The Generator had nothin' to do with it and never did. Mayor Sunny Skies: So none of it was my fault? Petunia Petals: No, ya big doofus! How many times have I tried to tell ya that? All those years, ya blamed yerself for nuthin'. Twilight Sparkle: These photos from the library explain  everything. Once I realized they were out of order, it proved that the  town's colors got dim before you turned on the Generator. Mayor Sunny Skies: Boy howdy, am I glad to hear that! But then, what did cause it? Twilight Sparkle: It's called "Hopeless Magic".  Everypony was already giving up each other, losing hope. Then, when the  Generator blew up, it must have been the last straw. It took all the  hope out of the town for good, along with the color. But now there's a  <span style="background-color:yellow">different</span> kind of magic. Of everypony coming together again. Just the  way you wanted it, Mayor. Torque Wrench: Whadaya know? There is still a Rainbow Festival. Twilight Sparkle: And we'd better get it started. This town's been waiting long enough. Torque Wrench: The Generator's workin' again, Mr. Mayor, just the way your grandpa built her. Mayor Sunny Skies: Heh. I just hope my speech lives up to the occasion. Twilight Sparkle: Attention, please! Welcome to the  brand new Hope Hollow Annual Rainbow Festival! And here's the pony who  made it all possible – Mayor Sunny Skies! [ponies cheering] Mayor Sunny Skies: I am as proud as a two-tailed peacock  to see you all here today to once again celebrate our little town at  the end of the rainbow. [cheering] Kerfuffle: Ohhh... Mayor Sunny Skies: And I can't give enough thanks to Rainbow Dash, Princess Twilight... Twilight Sparkle: [chuckles] Mayor Sunny Skies: ...Pinkie Pie... Pinkie Pie: [giggles] Mayor Sunny Skies: ...Fluttershy... Fluttershy: [giggles] Mayor Sunny Skies: ...Rarity, and Applejack. Applejack: Heh. Mayor Sunny Skies: My grandpa started this festival to  celebrate us, the ponies of Hope Hollow. It's you who brought friendship  back to our town, and all the bright colors that come with it. Girl Pony: Aw. Mayor Sunny Skies: We just have to always remember to  reach a hoof out to our neighbors, to respect and listen and talk to  each other. You never know what just sayin' "hello" to somepony can do.  So, without further ado... [Pinkie Pie]: Here we go This is the moment, yeah Let the Rainbow Festival begin!  Mayor Sunny Skies: [awkward laugh] [generator whirring] [ponies gasping] [magic sounds] Colt: Whoa, what's happening? Torque Wrench: Wow. Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Whoa. Kerfuffle: It's exactly as I imagined it! [ponies cheering] Petunia Petals: That was a beautiful speech, Sunny. Mayor Sunny Skies: What? Oh, no, uh, that wasn't my speech. Petunia Petals: Uh, but, uh, then what have you been writin' all day? Mayor Sunny Skies: Well, uh, another speech. I mean,  it's for later, but... Oh, flapjacks. I guess now is as good a time as  any. [sighs] Petunia, you've never given up on me or the town. You  always had hope when we had none, and I can't imagine a day without you.  You're the pony who brings color into my life. Petunia Petals, will you marry me? Petunia Petals: Of course, ya silly goose! [all cheering] Rainbow Dash: Attention, everypony! Introducing Hope Hollow's very own Junior Wonderbolts! [cheering] Barley Barrel: Did you hear what she called us?! Pickle Barrel: Did you hear what she called us?! Barley and Pickle Barrel: Junior Wonderbolts! [laugh] Pickle Barrel: All right! Barley and Pickle Barrel: [laugh] [music] Rainbow Dash: Okay, guys. Showtime! Pickle Barrel: [chuckles] [music continues] [boom!] [ponies cheering] Rainbow Dash: Heh. Now this is something I'm proud to be a guest of honor for! [gasps] Fluttershy: And it looks like there's a butterfly garden after all. Pinkie Pie: Only one more thing could make this Rainbow Festival better. Rarity: Oh, not more karaoke, darling. Pinkie Pie: What? No. A trout DJ! Trout Pony: [toots harmonica] [ponies cheering] Pinkie Pie: [laughs] Now that's a party! [All] We're living in color [Twilight Sparkle] Step out of the shadows and into the light Where it's bright and you might see all the colors you are [Rainbow Dash] Or any color you wanna be that your mind can see And wear them bright like a shining star [Rarity] Why just be black and white?

Welcome to this month's "Fancy  Fetch Unboxing with Spike"! I love pampering myself, and of course  putting it on the internet for you, my fans, first! #PuppySelfCare! I've  decided to splurge a little this month and get the deluxe package!  Let's get a better shot. Whoa! Look at this! Fabulous Fido's Faberge  Flying Disk. Of course you can't actually throw it. Far too delicate.  [kisses] Hmm. What other gems do we have here? Oh! Slippers to make your  paws feel plush! They're encrusted with locally-sourced amethysts.  Oh... my... goodness! [laughs] This is why I started vlogging in the  first place! I've been waiting for a sniff like this. It's a classic  white ankle sock. Cotton/nylon blend, two hundred wears deep, never  washed. This ain't no dry wick. This baby is as absorbent as they get!  [sniffs, sighs] [music stops] Spike: Huh? Twilight Sparkle: Spike! Did you spend two hundred dollars on a box with a dirty sock in it? Spike: [laughs nervously] Can't put a price on... #PuppySelfCare? [beep] Spike: And now, for my new show – "Reboxing and Returning Stuff". DIY with ApplejackEdit Applejack: On today's "DIY with Applejack", we're gonna build my friend Rarity a dream dressin' room – in just seventy-three easy steps! Rarity: Hello, darlings! I can't wait for my fabulous new dressing room and— Applejack: [clears throat] Rarity: Oh. Sorry. [laughs] Promise I won't make another peep. Applejack: Let's get started! Applejack: First, ya need wood. So, for step one, I'm gonna cut down one of my trees. Rarity: Ooh, just a dash of peep. How many trees are we going to need? [video fast-forwarding] Applejack: Step eight – gettin' rid of splinters. Now, ya  have to give each square foot of the surface thirty clockwise strokes  with the buffer... Rarity: Thirty?! Darling, that seems a bit excessive! Applejack: Yes. Thirty. And then you have to double-check those strokes by— Aw, shoot! I lost count! Well, I have to cut down a new tree. Rarity: [yawns] Yes, this is positively electrifying. [static] Applejack: Step <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>-nine – paintin' your room! I chose this practical brown color... Opalescence: [hisses] [static] Applejack: Step <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span>-nine-point-<span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> – paintin' your room with this, uh, very bright purple. Applejack: Step forty-two – adding tufted button walls! You're gonna wanna be careful, measurin' the satin at least twice... [video fast-forwarding] Applejack: Now that you've measured <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span> times, we can begin to cut the samples. Rarity: [clears throat] [static] [scissors snipping] [video fast-forwarding] Applejack: We just have to figure out which of the sixty-two samples... Rarity: [yawns] Applejack: ...work best. [clears throat] Now the real fun begins! Rarity: [sarcastically] Oh, now the real fun begins. I've been having so much fun the whole time. [sighs] Applejack: Rarity! Wake up!

Cup of sugar,  tablespoon of baking powder, dash of vanilla, pinch of salt, and for  our final ingredient, two Tank kisses! [smooches, slurps] Mmmm... Cotton  candy. This is taaaaaasty! [as Gummy] You've really outdone yourself,  Pinkie! [normally] Aw, thanks, Gummy! Now for the not-so-secret  ingredient – chocolate! [munches] Mmmm... mmm... [continues  munching] [as Gummy] Don't eat all the chips! [gulps, normally] Whoa. My  tum-tum. I didn't think there was such a thing as too much chocolate.  [belches] Now, to bake our creations! [kitchen timer ticking] Pinkie Pie: Mmm-mmm-mmm! [kitchen timer rings] Pinkie Pie: [gasps] They're ready! [splat] Pinkie Pie: [sniffs] What's that, Gummy?

Trixie Lulamoon: Magic, don't fail me now! Abraca—! [magic sounds] [crowd gasps] Trixie Lulamoon: —dabra?

A show that keeps you ahead of the curve, so you're always the  first girl on your block to wear the most glittering and glamorous  frocks in fashion! This week, I am bringing you the latest in summer  flair! So let's get started! As you can see, Applejack has a simply  scrumptious country style that really works for her. So I will just make  some simple tweaks. [flash] Rarity: [gasps] Sometimes I just shock myself with how good I am! Applejack: [shivering] Uh, d-d-d-don't you think it's a... pinch chilly for this getup? Rarity: Nonsense! You look gorgeous! And oh, so summer! Applejack: C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-cold... [geese honking] Fluttershy: Oh. They're starting to head north for the winter. Rarity: It may be fall, darling, but we in the fashion world are in summer mode. And now, so are you! [flash] Fluttershy: [shudders] Rarity: She's sporty! She's stylish! And she needs a  sensational summer look to dazzle all the other sports... people?  [clears throat] Anyway... [flash] Rarity: It's elegant yet still sporty! She'll be bringing drama along with the summer sun! Rainbow Dash: That... doesn't look like the sun to me. Rarity: Ignore the nature, Rainbow Dash. Summer chic is a  state of mind. We'll see you next time on "Street Chic with Rarity"!  Until then, don't forget to strike a pose! [plop!] Rainbow Dash: Uh, Rarity, you got anything for winter? Rarity: Ugh. Remind me to do our photoshoots indoors from now on. [shudders] Game StreamEdit Sunset Shimmer: Welcome to "ShimmerCode", my game  channel! I've decided to take a break from racking up crazy-high scores  to introduce my friend, Fluttershy, to gaming. Fluttershy: [quietly] Yay, games. Sunset Shimmer: Okay, Fluttershy, your pick. What'll it be? Fluttershy: Oh. The squirrel one. Sunset Shimmer: Yeah, sure. I usually play more advanced games, but what my guest player picks, we play. This will be... easy. Fluttershy: Time to press some buttons. Whee. Sunset Shimmer: Here we go! [video game music] Sunset Shimmer: The gameplay here is actually very simple. Get your squirrel to climb the tree...

[giggling] Sunset Shimmer: [grunting] Sunset Shimmer: [angrily] What do you want from me?! TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED! [sobs, screams] [video game sounds continue] Fluttershy: Yippee! Did I do it right? Sunset Shimmer: That was... amazing! Can I watch you play it again? Best in Show: The Pre-ShowEdit [dogs barking] Applejack: Howdy! And welcome to the first annual Canterlot Pet Show! Sure is great to be here, ain't it? Fluttershy: [quietly and stiltedly] "Sure is, Applejack. Can't wait to see all the wonderful contestants." Applejack: Heh. All righty, then. You heard the lady!  Let's meet 'em! This is the backstage area, where the pets get fresh and  spiffy before the competition. Right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy: Mm-hmm. Fresh and spiffy. Banana: [barks] Applejack: Why, look at this handsome feller! [to Flash] Tell us about your pooch! Flash Sentry: Oh! The dog's a Boston terrier named— Fluttershy: Banana!

What a cutie! Bulk Biceps' dog: [barks] Fluttershy: Oh, really? Bulk Biceps' dog: [barks] Fluttershy: She loves daytime TV, is a great listener, and— Applejack: Uh, I think the show will be startin' soon, so we should wrap this up. Fluttershy: I think we have time for one more quick interview. Applejack: Winona? Winona: [barks] Applejack: What are you doin' back here? Winona: [barks] Fluttershy: Awwww. [giggles] Winona only said that she wanted to surprise you by competing today! Applejack: Huh. Yee-haw! We gotta get ready to win that gold! [bell rings] Fluttershy: That's the signal! It's time to enjoy the cutest show in Canterlot! Best in Show: The Victory LapEdit Applejack: Giddyup! What a show! So many surprises and  one too many jugglin' acts, if you ask me. And now for the victory lap!  Here comes our participation winners! [crowd cheering] Fluttershy: I have such a hard time reading that Gummy. He's a pet of mystery. Applejack: Next up, our third place partners: Micro Chips and JVJ-24601. Uh... [quietly] Hey, Fluttershy, does a robot count as a pet? [electronic noises] Applejack: Uh, I mean, over to you, Fluttershy! Fluttershy: Thank you, Applejack! JVJ-24601 really wowed the judges with their super shiny coat. Applejack: Our second place team sure knows how to put a game face on durin' a tough competition! Fluttershy: Couldn't agree more, Applejack! And Tank kept his focus, despite the distraction of being totally in love. Bravo, Tank! Applejack: Huh. You sure do have the inside scoop, Fluttershy. Fluttershy: Well, Tank is a very talkative tortoise. Applejack: And our big winners! I dunno about you, Fluttershy, but I can't think of a more deservin' duo! Fluttershy: Yes, despite being in a horribly cranky mood  during the personality round, Fluffersnuff really turned on the charm  for the win! Fluttershy: You guys did great! [crowd cheering] [electronic noises] Schedule SwapEdit Principal Celestia: Welcome to another exciting school year at Canterlot High. [over P.A. system] As you settle into your new classes, please make sure everything's in order. Applejack: Everything's not in order! Where's Pinkie Pie? Fluttershy: Um, isn't Rarity in this class? Twilight Sparkle: But I thought Sunset Shimmer was in advanced physics with me. Sandalwood: This is regular physics, dude. Twilight Sparkle: What?! Principal Celestia: All final schedule changes must be made by the end of the day. [door opens] [girls panicking] [thud] Applejack: I was supposed to be in wood shop with Pinkie Pie, not frou-frou paintin' time with nobody. Fluttershy: I only signed up for drama to be with Rarity, but she wasn't there. Which was very dramatic, but for all the wrong reasons. Principal Celestia: Don't worry. I'll sort it out. [keys clacking] [printer whirring] Rarity: [sighs] Okay! Phew! Twilight Sparkle: Yes! Thank you! Rainbow Dash: All right! Rarity: [groans] This is the strangest math class I've ever been in. Zephyr Breeze: That's 'cause it's wood shop. [plays wood flute] Rainbow Dash: Huh. Sunset should be in here. Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie Pie, have you seen Sunset? Wait. I didn't know you were taking advanced physics. Pinkie Pie: Advanced physics? [laughs] Thank goodness! I thought they had ruined P.E.! Rainbow Dash, I'm on my way! Don't choose things without me! Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] [girls panicking] Principal Celestia: Girls! I think I can arrange for you all to have one class period together. But this is the final change, okay? [girls cheering] Applejack: Well, she wasn't lyin'. Lunch technically is a class period. Pinkie Pie: Best class to have together ever! [girls agreeing] Fluttershy: Um, has anyone seen Sunset? [keys clacking] Sunset Shimmer: I think I'm supposed to have lunch this period. Principal Celestia: [sighs] Twilight Under the StarsEdit Twilight Sparkle: Thank you so much for helping me with tonight's Canterlot Celestial Society Members' Social, Pinkie Pie. Pinkie Pie: No trouble, space rubble. Stars are like the glitter of the sky! Twilight Sparkle: I'm so nervous. My favorite  astrophysicist, Rosette Nebula, is here! She's so smart and cool and  probably very funny. Do you think she'll like me? Pinkie Pie: Of course she will. [guests clamoring] Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] There she is! Rosette Nebula! I just have to meet her! Pinkie Pie: And I have to get this celestial celebration into orbit! Woo-hoo! Space party! [music] Pinkie Pie: Hmm... Pinkie Pie: Party cannon! [boom!] [squeak!] [guests laughing] Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] [wheels squeaking] Pinkie Pie: Atomic chocolate cake! Rosette Nebula: Did you know the smell of chocolate increases brain waves and contains— Twilight Sparkle: The neurotransmitter serotonin, which triggers relaxation and contentment. Pinkie Pie: Mmm, sciency. Rosette Nebula: I'm Rosette Nebula. Twilight Sparkle: Oh! I'm Twilight Sparkle. It's such an honor to meet you. I'm so interested to hear about your theories on...

Sunset Shimmer: We'll see you guys there. I will have plenty of time to think about that. Fluttershy: [giggling] Rarity: I guess their plans don't involve me. Driver, take me home! Taxi Driver: Uh, lady, I need an address. [taxi stops] Rarity: I guess I'll just be alone by myself while all my friends are having fun together... without— Rest of Equestria Girls: Surprise! Happy birthday, Rarity! Rarity: Wha...? Rainbow Dash: You didn't think we'd let you spend your birthday alone, did you? Rarity: [stammers] Of course not, darling!

It's your music festival muses Rarity and Applejack here, presenting our camping must-haves. Applejack: Now, you're gonna be out in the hot sun all day long, so be sure to bring plenty of sunscreen. Rarity: Of course, your SPF won't be complete without a chapeau. And it should match your parasol and your blanket, of course. Applejack: But you don't really need all that. Rarity: And maybe a scarf. Applejack: I can think of two must-haves for makin' an outhouse feel like an in-house. Bring your own TP and plenty of hand sanitizer. Rarity: Be sure to include one or two all-natural moisturizers. It never hurts to have a whole set. Applejack: You can't go three days without 'em? Rarity: Oh, I'll fit them in, darling. I'll just tuck  them in next to the cushioned seat cover, air-freshening candle set, and  four-panel privacy screen. Applejack: [sighs] And finally, you'll need a sleepin' bag for a few hours of shuteye. Rarity: Plus pillows! Travel pillows, body pillows, accent pillows, throw pillows, bolster pillows, hypoallergenic pillows... Applejack: And where are you plannin' to put all them pillows? [scraping sounds] Rarity: [grunting] Just... [sighs] Applejack: Excuse me! What happened to bringin' only our must-haves? Rarity: This is a one-of-a-kind bespoke four-poster bed! I absolutely must have it! Applejack: Campin's about makin' do with what you got!  It's about breakin' off a stick to roast marshmallows or rustlin' up  pine needles for deodorant! Rarity: But, darling, we're not camping. Applejack: Huh? Rarity: We're glamping! [thuds] [clunk!] [fire roaring] [horn honking] Applejack: Well. I think I'm gonna like glampin'. Festival FiltersEdit [chattering] [click!] Rarity: Ooh, what filter are you going to use, darling? Sunset Shimmer: I was thinking about going #NoFilter. Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy: [gasp] Applejack: Not to sound like Granny Smith, but why do y'all care so much about a filter? All it does is make a new picture look... old. Rarity: [laughs] Oh, no-no-no-no-no, sweetheart, no. They are so much more. You can model the latest trend with "Shape Chic". [beeps] Applejack: I'd never wear a dodecahedron. [beeps] Fluttershy: If you're missing your friends, try "Flora/Fauna". [birds chirping] Fluttershy: Oh! [giggles] Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Check it out! [music playing] Rainbow Dash: [laughs] We're in a band! Applejack: Uh, we do that already. Fluttershy: "Fish Eye"! [click!] Rarity: "Birds' Eyes"! [click!] Rainbow Dash: "Normal Hair"! [click!] Rainbow Dash: You guys look great. Twilight Sparkle: "Watson"! [click!] Fluttershy: "Bigfoot Blurry in the Background"! [click!] [dramatic sting] Equestria Girls: [giggling] Fluttershy: Looks just like him. Rainbow Dash: "Pony"! [click!] ["My Little Pony" theme] Rainbow Dash: Uh... Pinkie Pie: Ooh! Party picture! Sunset Shimmer: This one is awesome! Fluttershy: That cake looks delicious. Applejack: I'll say. What's this filter called, Pinkie Pie? Pinkie Pie: What filter? [beat] [squeak!] Equestria Girls: [laughing] How to BackstageEdit [drone whirring] Sunset Shimmer: Hey, everybody. Sunset Shimmer here, your M.V.P. with a B.T.S. look at the V.I.P. life. Translation – I got a backstage pass! Sunset Shimmer: Need a break? First perk of the V.I.P.  treatment – swag, swag, swag, swag, swag! I'm talking foreign chocolate,  instant cameras, noise-canceling headphones... or... socks. Rock on!  Must be to keep the bands from getting cold feet. [chuckles] I  guess I'll just, uh, put them on. [grunts] Whoa. V.I.P. coming through! [thud] Sunset Shimmer: Check it out – the world-famous green  room, where all the bands hang out before the show. Any guesses on who  we'll see? Are you kidding me? This... is... amazing! You're lookin' at  the guy who invented pickup-only reverb! Ever wonder who does  PostCrush's light show? She runs a four-gel hot swap! [screams] This is  the best day of my life! Lighting Girl: Did you want to meet the band? Band Member: Cool socks. Sunset Shimmer: [laughs] Thanks. Can I get a picture? [band members laughing] [camera clicks] Sunset Shimmer: [squee] Sunset Shimmer: [narrating] And that's how you backstage. Festival LooksEdit Rarity: Some say the best part of a music festival is the music. But to me, it's fashion! Applejack: An old pair of cowboy boots will keep you from steppin' in a pile of... uh... fashion emergency. [pig oinks] Fluttershy: If you've got hang-ups with hangers, look for style right outside your window. [birds chirping] Rarity: [gasps] I believe they're famished for fashion. Fluttershy: Well, actually, they do want me to regurgitate worms into their beaks. [keys tapping] Rarity: Innovative! Who's next? Rainbow Dash: Make sure you can move whether you're dancing at the festival or after a hat trick. Rarity: Touchdown! Rainbow Dash: Uh, that's not what it's called— Sunset Shimmer: Can't go wrong with a classic. Pinkie Pie: Classic? You mean like... confetti? [squeak!] Pinkie Pie: Confetti everywhere! Hmm. Classic Pinkie Pie. Rarity: Aah! Pinkie Pie: Oops! Sorry. Twilight Sparkle: You know what's always in style?  Personal responsibility. Earplugs for high-decibel situation, a water  bottle, flashlight and compass in case you get lost, the other kind of  compass in case you need— Rarity: And there you have it, my loves. At the end of  the day, it's always in fashion to be utterly yourselves. See you at the  festival! <span style="background-color:yellow">Five</span> Lines You Need to Stand InEdit [indistinct chattering] [drone whirring] Pinkie Pie: Hello, computer net friends. Pinkie Pie  here, bringing you the list you've all been waiting for. Because anybody  who's anybody knows that music festivals aren't about the music or the  scene or even the camping. Which is why we're <span style="background-color:yellow">counting</span> down the <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>  lines you need to stand in! Oh, yeah! Pinkie Pie: First up, the security line. If we play this right, we might just make a new friend. Security Guard: Bag, please. Pinkie Pie: You can show off all the cool stuff in your purse. Security Guard: How in the—? Pinkie Pie: I know, right? Pinkie Pie: The only thing that tastes better than nachos  is nachos you waited two hours to get. Besides, how else could I ever  decide what I want on them? Which is everything! Ohhhh, delicious!  [eating noisily] Pinkie Pie: Up next, the photo booth line. Let's practice a pose! Say "cheese"! Say, cheese? "Watermelody": [gags] Pinkie Pie: Eh, your loss. [eating noisily] Pinkie Pie: Why not take a chance on a mystery line? It could lead to the coolest place you've ever seen! [to person in line] Do you know where this line goes? Person in Line: ["I-don't-know" sound] Pinkie Pie: Ah! Me, neither! But if it's this long, it's got to be good, right? [giggles] Pinkie Pie: Last, but certainly not least, is the bathroom line. Or, as I like to call it, the conga line! Cha-cha-cha, everybody! [students laughing] [conga music] Pinkie Pie: This is the best line ever! [door opens] Pinkie Pie: Congratulations! You made it! Find the MagicEdit [The Dazzlings] Where do we go?

			<a href="All Transcripts - My Little Pony Friendship is Magic Wiki.html#246Greaaat"><h3>2, 4, 6, Greaaat</h3></a>2, 4, 6, Greaaat [bird chirping] Twilight Sparkle: I have to admit I was a little shocked  when Princess Celestia told me she wanted to start a scholastic  buckball league. But I was even more surprised that she wanted the first game to be between her school and ours! Apparently, she's a huge sports fan. Pinkie Pie: Always thought Celestia was kind of a jock, just with really wavy hair. Twilight Sparkle: Anyway, we don't have much time. The game is in two weeks, and I want all of you to coach the team! [excited chattering] Fluttershy: [hyperventilating] Twilight Sparkle: I know how you feel. Young athletes ready to take the field. Ooh, you could almost breathe in the excitement! Fluttershy: [gasps] Snails: I don't think you should breathe it in so hard. [splash!] Fluttershy: It's just... Two weeks doesn't feel like a whole lot of time to train a whole team. Pinkie Pie: Mmmmaybe the School of Magic could play a  few other schools first. Like the Mane and Tail Styling College or the  Scroll-Making Institute? Twilight Sparkle: Relax. You're gonna do just fine. Fluttershy: Um, [gasps] what makes you so sure? Twilight Sparkle: Because I have faith in my friends, who also happen to be the best buckball players in Equestria! Pinkie Pie: Oh, yeah! [squeaks] [music] [smack!] [whoosh!] Fluttershy: I guess that is sort of true. Twilight Sparkle: I asked Rainbow Dash to help, too. But I'm not sure when she— [whooshes] Rainbow Dash: Sorry I'm late! But when Twilight said she  needed my help with the buckball team, I figured I'd better grab every  piece of coaching equipment I could find! So what should I focus on?  Offense? Defense? Trick plays? Twilight Sparkle: I was thinking of something even more important. Rainbow Dash: Awesome! Lay it on me. Whatever it is, I'll give it a hundred and <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent! Twilight Sparkle: I knew I could count on your enthusiasm! That's why I want you to coach the cheer squad! [thud] Rainbow Dash: Cheerleading?! [theme song] [music] Rainbow Dash: I don't mean to sound ungrateful. It's  just when you said you wanted my help with something important, I  thought you meant something important. Twilight Sparkle: The cheer squad is important. Rainbow Dash: [laughs hysterically] Oh. Well, sure,  cheer squad is totally important to somepony who isn't me. But I'm more  about ponies playing in the game, not cheering for it. [students laughing] Rainbow Dash: I mean, it's great that some ponies only want to cheer, though I don't know why they would. Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm. Well, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to find out. Rainbow Dash: Of course I've seen cheer squads before –  on the sidelines – but I'm not even a hundred percent sure what they do.  I'll probably just mess it up. Twilight Sparkle: I think you might be surprised. In fact, I'm more sure than ever that you're the perfect choice. Snips: I'm actually one hundred and <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent sure. And it's a good thing, too. The cheer squad really needs you. Rainbow Dash: What do you mean? Snips: Well, I've been helping out, and let's put it  this way. We've got two weeks until the big game, and... we could use  two years. But that's all gonna change because you're here to save the  day! Rainbow Dash: Okay... So why are you here? Snips: What? A pony can't show school spirit? Rainbow Dash: You don't even go to this school. Snips: Uh, okay. When I went to the Buckball Hall of  Fame, I found out buckball souvenirs are big bits. If Twilight's team  does well, I could start selling them full-time in Ponyville! So I have a vested interest, and you have an assistant coach! [blows whistle] Rainbow Dash: Ugh. Lighthoof and Shimmy Shake: [giggling] Lighthoof: [valley girl accent] She's here! Shimmy Shake: [valley girl accent] Get the lights! [rhythmically] Over and over and over again!  [Lighthoof] [rhythmically] We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!  Rainbow Dash: Dancing. Right. I've seen you two around school, haven't I? Shimmy Shake: [laughs] I'm Shimmy Shake, and this is Lighthoof. Lighthoof: And we are your lead dancers. [beat] Rainbow Dash: I didn't know you three would be here. Yona: [laughs] Yona want to cheer and make pony pyramid! [stomping] Ocellus: And I thought this could be my chance to make an impression on everypony. You know, for something other than changing shape. Rainbow Dash: I didn't realize you were into school spirit, Smolder. Smolder: Eh. I just came with these two. Guess they think you can make cheer squad cool or something. Rainbow Dash: Don't count on it. Snips: Okay! Now that we're all here, why don't you tell  us the plan? How are you gonna make us into the most awesome cheer  squad ever? Rainbow Dash: Eh... I'unno. Cheer Squad: [groan] Rainbow Dash: I mean, if you guys were an actual buckball team, I'd have plenty of ideas. But I don't know anything about cheerleading. Snips: Oh! [laughs] Yes! Good one, coach! But Headmare  Twilight picked you for the job, so I'm pretty sure you know what you're  doing. Rainbow Dash: If you say so. Snips: [laughs] Right. Okay, gang, let's show Rainbow Dash what we've been working on, and she can take it from there. Yona: Cheer squad can do that! [stomping] Lighthoof: Yup. All we need is a little music! [up-tempo music playing] Shimmy Shake: Over... and over... and over a...gain! [stomping] Lighthoof: We want to dance... for each other and for all of our friends! Smolder: [unenthusiastically] Two, four, six, eight. Ocellus: [quietly] Uh... friendship school is really... great. [stomping] [crash!] Smolder: Well, that was a disaster. Shimmy Shake: It's kind of hard to stick to our choreography when the floor is moving. Lighthoof: [scoffs] Yeah, Yona, your stomps are a little too powerful. Yona: Can we make pony pyramid instead? Ocellus: Maybe we should figure out what cheers we should do first. Smolder: [scoffs, sarcastically] Yeah, because that'll fix everything. Snips: So, I mean, there's a few... uh, a lot of problems, but nothing you can't solve, right? Rainbow Dash: Huh? Oh, yeah. Listen, you guys don't have anything to worry about. Smolder: We don't? Rainbow Dash: Nope. In fact, I think what you all just  did is totally fine. You guys have got this. So, uh, I'm just gonna head  down to the field. Uh, great practice, everypony! [whoosh] [door slams] Rainbow Dash: Ugh! What are you doing? Snips: [grunting] What are you doing?! You've got to come back and coach the squad! Rainbow Dash: I watched them cheer stuff. Looked fine to me. Snips: [grunts] Well, it's not! Do you know what'll happen if they do what they just did at the big game? Rainbow Dash: Uh, nothing? Snips: Uh, wrong! Rainbow Dash: Ooh! Snips: A good cheer squad gets the fans excited, which  gets the team excited. But if nopony's excited, then no... pony...  buys... any... souvenirs! Rainbow Dash: I think you're blowing this a little out of proportion. Snips: Point is, if I'm going to make any bits at these games, that squad has to get better. And to do that, they need a coach. Rainbow Dash: [gasps] You know what? You're right! Why don't you do it? I mean, you're the one with a vested interest. Snails: The trick to being a good buckball keeper is to do nothin'. Just empty your mind. Be the ball. Pizzelle: Uh, balls don't have minds. Snails: Exactly. [music] "November Rain": Uh, where's my blindfold? "Berry Bliss": My turn! Pizzelle: I want to do that! "Berry Bliss": Over here! Smolder: Why are you watching Snails' weird practice when you're supposed to be practicing with us? Rainbow Dash: [chuckles] Snails' practice is definitely weird. Uh, I thought Snips was practicing with you. Smolder: He was. Shimmy Shake: [sighs] Do you have any idea how hard it is to dance in this stuff? Ocellus: [softly] Plus all these buttons jingle so much, you can't hear my cheers. Smolder: Speaking up might help a little. Rainbow Dash: So don't dance and cheer. Yona: Uh, then what cheer squad do? Rainbow Dash: I dunno. Smolder: [angrily] Maybe you should! [calmly] Or whatever. You're the coach! You're supposed to come up with stuff for us to do. Rainbow Dash: Okay. I've got something for you to do. Snails: Just do nothing. Empty your minds. Be the squad. Smolder: We are the squad. Snails: Oh, yeah. Snips: At least helping sell my souvenirs was... something. Yona: Yona still not understand how this make us better. Huh? Professor Dash needs to stay and coach! Rainbow Dash: [groans] You guys asked me to come up with something, and I did. Smolder: I don't think nothing counts. Rainbow Dash: Then I'm out of ideas. Snails: This is the School of Friendship. If you need ideas, you should ask your friends for help. Rainbow Dash: Ugh, fine. [montage music] [party cannon squeak] Rainbow Dash: Okay. Since you guys have been nagging me nonstop about this cheer stuff for, like, ever... Smolder: It has literally been one day. Rainbow Dash: ...I went around and got everything you need! [music] Smolder: Uh, what're we supposed to do with hay? Rainbow Dash: Beats me, but Applejack seemed pretty sure about it. Oh, I almost forgot. Ocellus: A rhyming dictionary? Rainbow Dash: Yeah. Zecora's a lot less helpful than  you'd think. That's from the library so you can come up with cheers.  Okay! Good practice! Smolder: So, you're just leaving again? Rainbow Dash: Ugh! Look. I talked to my friends, and  they said this is the stuff you need. Wouldn't a true cheer squad be  able to figure out what to do with it? Lighthoof: But Fluttershy and Pinkie wanted us to show 'em everything we come up with tomorrow! Shimmy Shake: They want us to get the team all excited before the big game! Rainbow Dash: Well, then it's a good thing I got you all this stuff. You better get to work! [whoosh] [door slams] Snips: Don't look at me. [music] Fluttershy: Good work, everypony! Let's take a break! Rainbow Dash: [whistles] Yeah! [whistles] Wow! This team is really shaping up! Nice job! Fluttershy: Thanks. I'm excited to see what you've been up to. Pinkie Pie: Yeah! I can't wait to see the cheer squad! Rainbow Dash: [laughs hysterically] Oh. You're serious. Pinkie Pie: Woo-hoo! Go, team! This is so exciting! Fluttershy: Well, I'm sure you've put in a lot of hard work. Rainbow Dash: How much work does cheer squad need? Snips: Anypony want to buy an official School of  Friendship cheer squad headband? Now I personally would buy them before  the performance! Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy: Huh? [up-tempo music playing] [stomping] [Shimmy Shake] Over... and over... and over again!  [stomping continues] [Lighthoof] We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!  [Smolder] [unenthusiastically] School of Friendship, rah, rah, rah  [Ocellus] Let's win this game and hit the... oh, what rhymes with "rah"? Spa?  [stomping continues] [record needle scratches] [stomping continues] Shimmy Shake and Lighthoof: Yona! [creak] [party cannon squeak] Smolder: [blusters] Pinkie Pie: I know I said I couldn't wait to see the cheer squad, but maybe I could've waited just a teensy bit longer. Rainbow Dash: Oh, yeah! Nice one! Huh? What? Rainbow Dash: I don't know what everypony's so upset  about. So it wasn't great. Cheerleading's never great. That's why  everypony gets up to get a snack during it. Yona: [bawls loudly] Rainbow Dash: What is the big deal? Shimmy Shake: If you don't know, there's no point in us trying to explain it to you! Lighthoof: Lead dancers, out! Shimmy Shake and Lighthoof: Hmph! Smolder: It's not that we were bad. It's that you didn't even want to try to help us get better! Rainbow Dash: I didn't try? What are you talking about?!  I got you a party cannon! It's not my fault you couldn't figure out how  to use it right. Ocellus: [loudly] Well, you could have shown us! [sobbing] Rainbow Dash: Whoa. Ponies might actually care about cheer squad if she cheered like that all the time. Smolder: Why would you say ponies don't care about cheer squad? Rainbow Dash: Because they don't. Smolder: No. You don't. But they do! I bet  Headmare Twilight does! And you know what? I do, too! I actually got  excited when I found out you were gonna be our coach! I figured if  anypony can make cheer squad awesome, it's you! Rainbow Dash: Me? Why? Smolder: Because everything's always awesome with you! Or <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent cooler! Or whatever! You're the most enthusiastic pony in Equestria when it's something you care about. I just wish we were one of those things. [door opens, closes] Snips: And it looks like my assistant cheer  coach/souvenir selling business is a bust. So I'm gonna take off, unless  you can think of something else for me to do. Rainbow Dash: Maybe I can. Ocellus and Yona: [snoring] Snips: [blows whistle] Yona: Yaks hate loud noises! Ocellus: Aah! Snips: Squad meeting! Outside! ASAP! [new age music] [record needle scratches] Snips: [blows whistle] Dance ponies, buckball field, pronto! [thud] Smolder: [snoring] Snips: [blows whistle] Hey, dragon! Get out here and join your squad! Smolder: So, what? Is there some new button you wanna sell? Snips: Not a button. [whooshes] Cheer Squad: Ugh... Smolder: Not this again. Lighthoof: Sorry. We're not buying. Rainbow Dash: Wait! Look, I know I haven't been a great coach because I don't care about cheerleading. But  all of you do, and I care about you. So I guess maybe I care about  cheer squad. And a good friend reminded me that I can make anything I  care about totally awesome. So from now on, I'm gonna give this thing a  hundred and <span style="background-color:yellow">twenty</span> percent, and I expect the same from you. We are gonna  dance! We are gonna cheer! We're gonna make the biggest pony pyramid  Equestria's ever seen! And when we're done, we're gonna make sure  everypony on that field is so pumped up, they'll forget they even came  to see a game! Snips: Ah! But not so pumped up that they forget to buy a pennant or a button or a quality souvenir T-shirt. [beat] Snips: What? [montage music] [stomping] Rainbow Dash: [blows whistle in time with stomping] Rainbow Dash: [blows whistle] [music continues] [hissing] Rainbow Dash: [coughing] [hissing] [party cannon squeak] Cheer Squad: [laughs] [crowd cheering] Twilight Sparkle: Yahoo! Princess Celestia: I realize the game of buckball  traditionally requires an Earth pony, a Pegasus, and a unicorn, but I  appreciate you allowing my students to compete. Twilight Sparkle: Of course, and the wings and magical-dampening ring you made seem to be working really well. Princess Celestia: Indeed, though not as well as your team. [echoing] Come on, School of Magic! Fluttershy: Ohhhh! The suspense is horrible! I'm the most nervous I've ever been, and that's saying something. Rainbow Dash: I know how you feel! Pinkie Pie: Don't worry! Celestia's team might be tough, but we can still win this thing! Rainbow Dash: What? Oh, yeah, totally. But I wasn't talking about the game. Come on, come on, come on, come on! [cheering] Announcer: And that's the end of the first half! Rainbow Dash: Aaah! Sorry! Can't talk right now! Fluttershy: I sure hope Dash being nervous is a good sign. [ponies chattering] [up-tempo music playing] [stomping] [Shimmy Shake] Over and over and over again! [Lighthoof] We'll cheer for our team 'til the ve-ry end! [rhythmic stomping] [crowd cheering] Smolder: [blows smoke] [Ocellus] Everypony in the crowd, if you're feeling hip When I say "friend-", you say "-ship"! Friend! [Crowd] Ship! [Ocellus] Friend! [Crowd] Ship! [Ocellus] Welcome, everypony, to the halftime show We're the friendship squad, and we're ready to go! We're here to cheer and get you all excited If you'd like to join in, then you're all invited! It's a simple cheer, so don't chime in late [All] It goes two, four, six, GREAT! [party cannon squeak] [flames whooshing] [cheers and applause] Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Not bad, right? Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy: They... were... awesome! Cheer Squad: [laughing] Rainbow Dash: Well, they have a pretty decent coach. Cheer Squad: [laughing] [crowd cheering] Announcer: And that's the game. Final score — School of Magic, <span style="background-color:yellow">five</span>; School of Friendship, four. Fluttershy: Nice work, everyone. You can't win them all. Pinkie Pie: Sometimes, that's just how the cupcake crumbles. Rainbow Dash: You guys were amazing! School of Friendship Team: [groans] Rainbow Dash: It was flawless. I can't think of any way that could've been better! Smolder: We could have won the game. Rainbow Dash: [scoffs] The game was just a sideshow. You guys were the main event! Princess Celestia: I'm glad to see such good  sportsponyship on display. Your cheer squad was an inspiration, Rainbow  Dash. I'll have to start one at my school as well. Twilight Sparkle: Wow, Rainbow Dash! It's almost like you were the perfect pony to coach cheer squad after all! Rainbow Dash: Wait a second. Was this one of those things where you knew the lesson I needed to learn before I learnt it? Twilight Sparkle: You mean like how you don't have to  care about a thing other ponies like as long as you care about the  ponies who like it? Nope. Don't know what you're talking about. Rainbow Dash: Ugh! Princess Celestia: Nicely done. All: [laughing] [credits]			<br>
